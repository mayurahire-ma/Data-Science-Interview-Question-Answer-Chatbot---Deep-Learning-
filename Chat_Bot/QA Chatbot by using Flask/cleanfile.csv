1,  How do you interpret a linear regression model?,"As we know that the linear regression model is of the form:The significance of the linear regression model lies in the fact that we can easily interpret and understand the marginal changes in the independent variables(predictors) and observed their consequences on the dependent variable(response).Therefore, a linear regression model is quite easy to interpret.For Example, if we increase the value of x1 increases by 1 unit, keeping other variables constant, then the total increase in the value of y will be βi and the intercept term (β0) is the response when all the predictor’s terms are set to zero or not considered.",interpret linear regress
2,  What are the basic assumptions of the Linear Regression Algorithm?,"The basic assumptions of the Linear regression algorithm are as follows: Linearity: The relationship between the features and target. Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data. ",assumpt linear regress
3,  Explain the difference between Correlation and Regression.,Correlation: It measures the strength or degree of relationship between two variables. It doesn’t capture causality. It is visualized by a single point.Regression: It measures how one variable affects another variable. Regression is all about model fitting. It tries to capture the causality and describes the cause and the effect. It is visualized by a regression line.,correl regress
4,  Explain the Gradient Descent algorithm with respect to linear regression.,"Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)",descent gradient linear regress

So, we can go for a linear model if the relationship looks somewhat linear. Plotting the scatter plots is easy in the case of simple or univariate linear regression.But if we have more than one independent variable i.e, the case of multivariate linear regression, then two-dimensional pairwise scatter plots, rotating plots, and dynamic graphs can be plotted to find the suitableness.On the contrary, to make the relationship linear we have to apply some transformations.",case dataset justifi linear regress suitabl

In simple words, we plot quantiles against quantiles in the Q-Q plot which is used to check the normality of errors.Whenever we interpret a Q-Q plot, we should concentrate on the ‘y = x’ line, which corresponds to a normal distribution. Sometimes, this line is also known as the 45-degree line in statistics.It implies that each of the distributions has the same quantiles. In case you witness a deviation from this line, one of the distributions could be skewed when compared to the other i.e, normal distribution.",interpret linear plot qq regress
8,"  In linear regression, what is the value of the sum of the residuals for a given dataset?

19,  When should it be preferred to the Gradient Descent method instead of the Normal Equation in Linear Regression Algorithm?,"To answer the given question, let’s first understand the difference between the Normal equation and Gradient descent method for linear regression: Needs hyper-parameter tuning for alpha (learning parameter). It is an iterative process. Time complexity- O(kn2) Preferred when n is extremely large.  No such need for any hyperparameter. It is a non-iterative process. Time complexity- O(n3) due to evaluation of XTX. Becomes quite slow for large values of n. where,‘k’ represents the maximum number of iterations used for the gradient descent algorithm, and‘n’ is the total number of observations present in the training dataset.Clearly, if we have large training data, a normal equation is not preferred for use due to very high time complexity but for small values of ‘n’, the normal equation is faster than gradient descent.",descent equat gradient instead linear method normal prefer regress
20,  What are R-squared and Adjusted R-squared?,"R-square (R2), also known as the coefficient of determination measures the proportion of the variation in your dependent variable (Y) explained by your independent variables (X) for a linear regression model.The main problem with the R-squared is that it will always remain the same or increases as we are adding more independent variables. Therefore, to overcome this problem, an Adjusted-R2 square comes into the picture by penalizing those adding independent variables that do not improve your existing model.To learn more about, R2 and adjusted-R2, refer to the link.",adjust rsquar rsquar
21,  What are the flaws in R-squared?,"There are two major flaws of R-squared:Problem- 1: As we are adding more and more predictors, R² always increases irrespective of the impact of the predictor on the model. As R² always increases and never decreases, it can always appear to be a better fit with the more independent variables(predictors) we add to the model. This can be completely misleading.Problem- 2: Similarly, if our model has too many independent variables and too many high-order polynomials, we can also face the problem of over-fitting the data. Whenever the data is over-fitted, it can lead to a misleadingly high R² value which eventually can lead to misleading predictions.To learn more about, flaws of R2, refer to the link.",flaw rsquar
22,  What is Multicollinearity?,"It is a phenomenon where two or more independent variables(predictors) are highly correlated with each other i.e. one variable can be linearly predicted with the help of other variables.

To check whether an independent variable (predictor) is significant or not for the prediction of the target variable. Two common methods for this are —If the p-value of a particular independent variable is greater than a certain threshold (usually 0.05), then that independent variable is insignificant for the prediction of the target variable.If the value of the regression coefficient corresponding to a particular independent variable is zero, then that variable is insignificant for the predictions of the dependent variable and has no linear relationship with it.",hypothesi linear regress test

Moreover, time-series data have a pattern, such as during peak hours, festive seasons, etc., which would most likely be treated as outliers in the linear regression analysis.

In layman terms, feature engineering means the development of new features that may help you understand and model the problem in a better way. Feature engineering is of two kinds — business driven and data-driven. Business-driven feature engineering revolves around the inclusion of features from a business point of view. The job here is to transform the business variables into features of the problem. In the case of data-driven feature engineering, the features you add do not have any significant physical interpretation, but they help the model in the prediction of the target variable.FYI: Free nlp course! 
To apply feature engineering, one must be fully acquainted with the dataset.

40,  What is the use of regularisation? Explain L1 and L2 regularisations.,"Regularisation is a technique that is used to tackle the problem of overfitting of the model. When a very complex model is implemented on the training data, it overfits. At times, the simple model might not be able to generalise the data and the complex model overfits. To address this problem, regularisation is used.Regularisation is nothing but adding the coefficient terms (betas) to the cost function so that the terms are penalised and are small in magnitude. This essentially helps in capturing the trends in the data and at the same time prevents overfitting by not letting the model become too complex. ",l1 l2 regularis regularis use
41,  How to choose the value of the parameter learning rate (α)?,"Selecting the value of learning rate is a tricky business. If the value is too small, the gradient descent algorithm takes ages to converge to the optimal solution. On the other hand, if the value of the learning rate is high, the gradient descent will overshoot the optimal solution and most likely never converge to the optimal solution.To overcome this problem, you can try different values of alpha over a range of values and plot the cost vs the number of iterations. Then, based on the graphs, the value corresponding to the graph showing the rapid decrease can be chosen.

The aforementioned graph is an ideal cost vs the number of iterations curve. Note that the cost initially decreases as the number of iterations increases, but after certain iterations, the gradient descent converges and the cost does not decrease anymore.If you see that the cost is increasing with the number of iterations, your learning rate parameter is high and it needs to be decreased.

42,  How to choose the value of the regularisation parameter (λ)?,"Selecting the regularisation parameter is a tricky business. If the value of λ is too high, it will lead to extremely small values of the regression coefficient β, which will lead to the model underfitting (high bias – low variance). On the other hand, if the value of λ is 0 (very small), the model will tend to overfit the training data (low bias – high variance).There is no proper way to select the value of λ. What you can do is have a sub-sample of data and run the algorithm multiple times on different sets. Here, the person has to decide how much variance can be tolerated. Once the user is satisfied with the variance, that value of λ can be chosen for the full dataset.One thing to be noted is that the value of λ selected here was optimal for that subset, not for the entire training data.

45,  How does multicollinearity affect the linear regression?,"Ans Multicollinearity occurs when some of the independent variables are highly correlated (positively or negatively) with each other. This multicollinearity causes a problem as it is against the basic assumption of linear regression. The presence of multicollinearity does not affect the predictive capability of the model. So, if you just want predictions, the presence of multicollinearity does not affect your output. However, if you want to draw some insights from the model and apply them in, let’s say, some business model, it may cause problems.One of the major problems caused by multicollinearity is that it leads to incorrect interpretations and provides wrong insights. The coefficients of linear regression suggest the mean change in the target value if a feature is changed by one unit. So, if multicollinearity exists, this does not hold true as changing one feature will lead to changes in the correlated variable and consequent changes in the target variable. This leads to wrong insights and can produce hazardous results for a business.A highly effective way of dealing with multicollinearity is the use of VIF (Variance Inflation Factor). Higher the value of VIF for a feature, more linearly correlated is that feature. Simply remove the feature with very high VIF value and re-train the model on the remaining dataset.

If the residuals are distributed normally, with a mean around the fitted value and a constant variance, our model is working fine; otherwise, there is some issue with the model.The most common problem that can be found when training the model over a large range of a dataset is heteroscedasticity(this is explained in the answer below). The presence of heteroscedasticity can be easily seen by plotting the residual vs fitted value curve.",curv fit interpret residu v valu
51,"  What is heteroscedasticity? What are the consequences, and how can you overcome it?","A random variable is said to be heteroscedastic when different subpopulations have different variabilities (standard deviation). 
The existence of heteroscedasticity gives rise to certain problems in the regression analysis as the assumption says that error terms are uncorrelated and, hence, the variance is constant. The presence of heteroscedasticity can often be seen in the form of a cone-like scatter plot for residual vs fitted values.One of the basic assumptions of linear regression is that heteroscedasticity is not present in the data. Due to the violation of assumptions, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimators are not the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE). Hence, they do not give the least variance than other Linear Unbiased Estimators (LUEs).

55,  Explain gradient descent with respect to linear regression.,"Gradient descent is an optimisation algorithm. In linear regression, it is used to optimise the cost function and find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimised value of the cost function.
Gradient descent works like a ball rolling down a graph (ignoring the inertia). The ball moves along the direction of the greatest gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface (minima).

A regression model with OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is quite sensitive to the outliers. To overcome this problem, we can use the WLS (Weighted Least Squares) method to determine the estimators of the regression coefficients. Here, less weights are given to the outliers or high leverage points in the fitting, making these points less impactful. ",regress robust
58,  Which graphs are suggested to be observed before model fitting?,"Before fitting the model, one must be well aware of the data, such as what the trends, distribution, skewness, etc. in the variables are. Graphs such as histograms, box plots, and dot plots can be used to observe the distribution of the variables.

60,  Explain the bias-variance trade-off.,"Bias refers to the difference between the values predicted by the model and the real values. It is an error. One of the goals of an ML algorithm is to have a low bias.
Variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to small fluctuations in the training dataset. Another goal of an ML algorithm is to have low variance.For a dataset that is not exactly linear, it is not possible to have both bias and variance low at the same time. A straight line model will have low variance but high bias, whereas a high-degree polynomial will have low bias but high variance.There is no escaping the relationship between bias and variance in machine learning.So, there is a trade-off between the two; the ML specialist has to decide, based on the assigned problem, how much bias and variance can be tolerated. Based on this, the final model is built.",biasvari tradeoff
61,  How can learning curves help create a better model?,"Learning curves give the indication of the presence of overfitting or underfitting. 
In a learning curve, the training error and cross-validating error are plotted against the number of training data points. A typical learning curve looks like this:

If the training error and true error (cross-validating error) converge to the same value and the corresponding value of the error is high, it indicates that the model is underfitting and is suffering from high bias.",better creat curv learn

For a binary classification problem, we know that the output can be either 0 or 1. This is just like our simple logistic regression, where we use a logit function to generate a probability between 0 and 1.So, what’s the difference between the two?Simply put, it is just the difference in the threshold function! When we restrict the logistic regression model to give us either exactly 1 or exactly 0, we get a Perceptron model:",logist perceptron regress
65,  Can we have the same bias for all neurons of a hidden layer?,"Essentially, you can have a different bias value at each layer or at each neuron as well. However, it is best if we have a bias matrix for all the neurons in the hidden layers as well.A point to note is that both these strategies would give you very different results.",bia hidden layer neuron
66,  What if we do not use any activation function(s) in a neural network?,"The main aim of this question is to understand why we need activation functions in a neural network. You can start off by giving a simple explanation of how neural networks are built:Step 1: Calculate the sum of all the inputs (X) according to their weights and include the bias term:Z = (weights * X) + biasStep 2: Apply an activation function to calculate the expected output:Y = Activation(Z)Steps 1 and 2 are performed at each layer. If you recollect, this is nothing but forward propagation! Now, what if there is no activation function?Our equation for Y essentially becomes:Y = Z = (weights * X) + biasWait – isn’t this just a simple linear equation? Yes – and that is why we need activation functions. A linear equation will not be able to capture the complex patterns in the data – this is even more evident in the case of deep learning problems.In order to capture non-linear relationships, we use activation functions, and that is why a neural network without an activation function is just a linear regression model.",activ function network neural use
67,"  In a neural network, what if all the weights are initialized with the same value?","In simplest terms, if all the neurons have the same value of weights, each hidden unit will get exactly the same signal. While this might work during forward propagation, the derivative of the cost function during backward propagation would be the same every time.In short, there is no learning happening by the network! What do you call the phenomenon of the model being unable to learn any patterns from the data? Yes, underfitting.Therefore, if all weights have the same initial value, this would lead to underfitting.Note: This question might further lead to questions on exploding and vanishing gradients, which I have covered below.",initi network neural valu weight

69,  What is the role of weights and bias in a neural network?,"This is a question best explained with a real-life example. Consider that you want to go out today to play a cricket match with your friends. Now, a number of factors can affect your decision-making, like:And so on. These factors can change your decision greatly or not too much. For example, if it is raining outside, then you cannot go out to play at all. Or if you have only one bat, you can share it while playing as well. The magnitude by which these factors can affect the game is called the weight of that factor.Factors like the weather or temperature might have a higher weight, and other factors like equipment would have a lower weight.However, does this mean that we can play a cricket match with only one bat? No – we would need 1 ball and 6 wickets as well. This is where bias comes into the picture. Bias lets you assign some threshold which helps you activate a decision-point (or a neuron) only when that threshold is crossed.",bia network neural role weight

Just like normalizing our input helps improve our logistic regression model, we can normalize the activations of the hidden layers in our deep learning model as well:We basically normalize a[1] and a[2] here.

74,  Why does a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) work better with image data?,"The key to this question lies in the Convolution operation. Unlike humans, the machine sees the image as a matrix of pixel values. Instead of interpreting a shape like a petal or an ear, it just identifies curves and edges.Thus, instead of looking at the entire image, it helps to just read the image in parts. Doing this for a 300 x 300 pixel image would mean dividing the matrix into smaller 3 x 3 matrices and dealing with them one by one. This is convolution.Mathematically, we just perform a small operation on the matrix to help us detect features in the image – like boundaries, colors, etc.Z = X * fHere, we are convolving (* operation – not multiplication) the input matrix X with another small matrix f, called the kernel/filter to create a new matrix Z. This matrix is then passed on to the other layers.If you have a board/screen in front of you, you can always illustrate this with a simple example:Learning more about how CNNs work here.",better cnn convolut data network neural work
75,  Why do RNNs work better with text data?,"The main component that differentiates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) from the other models is the addition of a loop at each node. This loop brings the recurrence mechanism in RNNs. In a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN), each input is given the same weight and fed to the network at the same time. So, for a sentence like “I saw the movie and hated it”, it would be difficult to capture the information which associates “it” with the “movie”.The addition of a loop is to denote preserving the previous node’s information for the next node, and so on. This is why RNNs are much better for sequential data, and since text data also is sequential in nature, they are an improvement over ANNs. ",better data rnn text work
76,"  In a CNN, if the input size 5 X 5 and the filter size is 7 X 7, then what would be the size of the output?","This is a pretty intuitive answer. As we saw above, we perform the convolution on ‘x’ one step at a time, to the right, and in the end, we got Z with dimensions 2 X 2, for X with dimensions 3 X 3.Thus, to make the input size similar to the filter size, we make use of padding – adding 0s to the input matrix such that its new size becomes at least 7 X 7. Thus, the output size would be using the formula:Dimension of image = (n, n) = 5 X 5Dimension of filter = (f,f)  = 7 X 7Padding = 1 (adding 1 pixel with value 0 all around the edges)Dimension of output will be (n+2p-f+1) X (n+2p-f+1) = 1 X 1",5 5 7 7 cnn filter input output size size size would x x

78,  What do you mean by exploding and vanishing gradients?,"The key here is to make the explanation as simple as possible. As we know, the gradient descent algorithm tries to minimize the error by taking small steps towards the minimum value. These steps are used to update the weights and biases in a neural network.However, at times, the steps become too large and this results in larger updates to weights and bias terms – so much so as to cause an overflow (or a NaN) value in the weights. This leads to an unstable algorithm and is called an exploding gradient.On the other hand, the steps are too small and this leads to minimal changes in the weights and bias terms – even negligible changes at times. We thus might end up training a deep learning model with almost the same weights and biases each time and never reach the minimum error function. This is called the vanishing gradient.A point to note is that both these issues are specifically evident in Recurrent Neural Networks – so be prepared for follow-up questions on RNN!",explod gradient mean vanish
79,  What are the applications of transfer learning in Deep Learning?,"I am sure you would have a doubt as to why a relatively simple question was included in the Intermediate Level.

Training a large model on a huge dataset, and then using the final parameters on smaller simpler datasets has led to defining breakthroughs in the form of Pretrained Models. Be it Computer Vision or NLP, pretrained models have become the norm in research and in the industry.Some popular examples include BERT, ResNet, GPT-2, VGG-16, etc and many more.It is here that you can earn brownie points by pointing out specific examples/projects where you used these models and how you used them as well.It is not possible to discuss all of them, so here are a few resources to get started:It is here that questions become really specific to your projects or to what you have discussed in the interview before.Also, depending on the domain – with Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing, these questions can change. While it is not important to know the architecture of each model in detail, you would need to know the intuition behind them and why these models were needed in the first place.Again, just like the intermediate level, it is important to always bring in examples that you have studied or implemented yourself into the discussion.",applic deep learn learn transfer
80,  How backpropagation is different in RNN compared to ANN?,"In Recurrent Neural Networks, we have an additional loop at each node:This loop essentially includes a time component into the network as well. This helps in capturing sequential information from the data, which could not be possible in a generic artificial neural network.This is why the backpropagation in RNN is called Backpropagation through Time, as in backpropagation at each time step.You can find a detailed explanation of RNNs here: Fundamentals of Deep Learning – Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks.",ann backpropag compar differ rnn
81,  How does LSTM solve the vanishing gradient challenge?,"The LSTM model is considered a special case of RNNs. The problems of vanishing gradients and exploding gradients we saw earlier are a disadvantage while using the plain RNN model.In LSTMs, we add a forget gate, which is basically a memory unit that retains information that is retained across timesteps and discards the other information that is not needed. This also necessitates the need for input and output gates to include the results of the forget gate as well.",challeng gradient lstm solv vanish
82,  Why is GRU faster as compared to LSTM?,"As you can see, the LSTM model can become quite complex. In order to still retain the functionality of retaining information across time and yet not make a too complex model, we need GRUs.Basically, in GRUs, instead of having an additional Forget gate, we combine the input and Forget gates into a single Update Gate:It is this reduction in the number of gates that makes GRU less complex and faster than LSTM.

It is usually known as Back-propagation Through Time (BTT).There are two significant issues with Back-propagation, such as: Vanishing Gradient When we perform Back-propagation, the gradients tend to get smaller and smaller because we keep on moving backward in the Network. As a result, the neurons in the earlier layer learn very slowly if we compare it with the neurons in the later layers.Earlier layers are more valuable because they are responsible for learning and detecting simple patterns. They are the building blocks of the network. If they provide improper or inaccurate results, then how can we expect the next layers and complete network to perform nicely and provide accurate results. The training procedure tales long, and the prediction accuracy of the model decreases. Exploding Gradient Exploding gradients are the main problem when large error gradients accumulate. They provide result in very large updates to neural network model weights during training. Gradient Descent process works best when updates are small and controlled. When the magnitudes of the gradient accumulate, an unstable network is likely to occur. It can cause poor prediction of results or even a model that reports nothing useful.

150,"  What is Overfitting and Underfitting, and How to Combat Them?","Overfitting occurs when the model learns the details and noise in the training data to the degree that it adversely impacts the execution of the model on new information. It is more likely to occur with nonlinear models that have more flexibility when learning a target function. An example would be if a model is looking at cars and trucks, but only recognizes trucks that have a specific box shape. It might not be able to notice a flatbed truck because there's only a particular kind of truck it saw in training. The model performs well on training data, but not in the real world.Underfitting alludes to a model that is neither well-trained on data nor can generalize to new information. This usually happens when there is less and incorrect data to train a model.

On the other hand, L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, encourages the weights to be small but not necessarily zero, leading to a more diffuse, small weight distribution. It helps in preventing overfitting by penalizing the magnitude of the weights without promoting sparsity.",affect discus distribut l1 l2 network neural regular term weight
252,  How would you design a CNN to handle input images of varying sizes?,"To design a CNN for handling input images of varying sizes, one approach is to incorporate global average pooling layers towards the end of the network.

261,  What is Selection Bias?,"Selection bias is a kind of error that occurs when the researcher decides who is going to be studied. It is usually associated with research where the selection of participants isn’t random. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect. It is the distortion of statistical analysis, resulting from the method of collecting samples. If the selection bias is not taken into account, then some conclusions of the study may not be accurate.The types of selection bias include:Sampling bias: It is a systematic error due to a non-random sample of a population causing some members of the population to be less likely to be included than others resulting in a biased sample.Time interval: A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for ethical reasons), but the extreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance, even if all variables have a similar mean.Data: When specific subsets of data are chosen to support a conclusion or rejection of bad data on arbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria.Attrition: Attrition bias is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants) discounting trial subjects/tests that did not run to completion.",bia select
262,  What is a bias-variance trade-off?,"Bias: Bias is an error introduced in your model due to the oversimplification of the machine learning algorithm. It can lead to underfitting. When you train your model at that time model makes simplified assumptions to make the target function easier to understand.Low bias machine learning algorithms — Decision Trees, k-NN and SVM High bias machine learning algorithms — Linear Regression, Logistic RegressionVariance: Variance is error introduced in your model due to a complex machine learning algorithm, your model learns noise also from the training data set and performs badly on test data set. It can lead to high sensitivity and overfitting.Normally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in error due to lower bias in the model. However, this only happens until a particular point. As you continue to make your model more complex, you end up over-fitting your model and hence your model will start suffering from high variance.Bias-Variance trade-off: The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to have low bias and low variance to achieve good prediction performance.The k-nearest neighbour algorithm has low bias and high variance, but the trade-off can be changed by increasing the value of k which increases the number of neighbours that contribute to the prediction and in turn increases the bias of the model.The support vector machine algorithm has low bias and high variance, but the trade-off can be changed by increasing the C parameter that influences the number of violations of the margin allowed in the training data which increases the bias but decreases the variance.There is no escaping the relationship between bias and variance in machine learning. Increasing the bias will decrease the variance. Increasing the variance will decrease bias.ChatGPT Tutorial | ChatGPT Explained | What is ChatGPT ? | Edureka This 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐆𝐏𝐓 𝐓𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 is intended as a Crash Course on 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐆𝐏𝐓 for Beginners.

The probability of an event always lies between(including) 0 and 1.Factorial -it is used to find the total number of ways n number of things can be arranged in n places without repetition. Its value is n multiplied by all natural numbers till n-1.eg. 5!=5X4X3X2X1=120Permutation– It is used when replacement is not allowed, and the order of items is important. Its formula is-Where,n is the total number of itemsR is the number of ways items are being selectedCombination– It is used when replacement is not allowed, and the order of items is not important. Its formula is-Some rules for probability are-Addition RuleP(A or B)= P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B)Conditional probabilityIt is the probability of event B occurring, assuming that event A has already occurred.P(A and B)= P(A) .

275,"  Describe different regularization methods, such as L1 and L2 regularization","There are 3 important regularization methods as follows-L2 regularization-(Ridge regression)– In L2 regularization, we add the sum of the squares of all the weights, multiplied by a value lambda, to the loss function. The formula for Ridge regression is as follows-As you can see, if the value of the weights multiplied by the data value for a particular data point and feature becomes very large, the original loss will become small. But the added value of lambda multiplied with the sum of squares of weights will become large as well. Similarly, if the original loss value becomes very large, the added value will become small. Thus it will control the final value from becoming too large or too small.L1 Regularization-(Lasso regression)– In L1 regularization, we add the sum of the absolute values of all the weights, multiplied by a value lambda, to the loss function. The formula for Lasso regression is as follows-The loss function along with the optimization algorithm brings parameters near to zero but not actually zero, while lasso eliminates less important features and sets respective weight values to zero.This is used for regularization in neural networks. Fully connected layers are more prone to overfitting. Dropout leaves out some neurons with 1-p probability in neural networks. Dropout reduces overfitting, improves training speed, and makes the model more robust. ",differ l1 l2 method regular regular
276,  How should you maintain a deployed model?,"After a model has been deployed, it needs to be maintained. The data being fed may change over time. For example, in the case of a model predicting house prices, the prices of houses may rise over time or fluctuate due to some other factor. The accuracy of the model on new data can be recorded. Some common ways to ensure accuracy include-If the model shows good prediction accuracy with new data, it means that the new data follows the pattern or the generalization learned by the model on old data. So, the model can be retrained on the new data. If the accuracy on new data is not that good, the model can be retrained on the new data with feature engineering on the data features along with the old data.If the accuracy is not good, the model may need to be trained from scratch.",deploy maintain

There is no way to get seven equal outcomes from a single rolling of a die. If we roll the die twice and consider the event of two rolls, we now have 36 different outcomes.  To get our 7 equal outcomes we have to reduce this 36 to a number divisible by 7. We can thus consider only 35 outcomes and exclude the other one.  A simple scenario can be to exclude the combination (6,6), i.e., to roll the die again if 6 appears twice.  All the remaining combinations from (1,1) till (6,5) can be divided into 7 parts of 5 each.

Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfitted, has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data.Underfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm cannot capture the underlying trend of the data. Underfitting would occur, for example, when fitting a linear model to non-linear data. Such a model too would have poor predictive performance.",differ overfit underfit

If our labels are discrete values then it will a classification problem, e.g A,B etc. but if our labels are continuous values then it will be a regression problem, e.g 1.23, 1.333 etc.",classif ml regress techniqu
333,  What are Recommender Systems?,"Recommender Systems are a subclass of information filtering systems that are meant to predict the preferences or ratings that a user would give to a product. Recommender systems are widely used in movies, news, research articles, products, social tags, music, etc.Examples include movie recommenders in IMDB, Netflix & BookMyShow, product recommenders in e-commerce sites like Amazon, eBay & Flipkart, YouTube video recommendations and game recommendations in Xbox.",recommend system
334,  What is Collaborative filtering?,"The process of filtering used by most of the recommender systems to find patterns or information by collaborating viewpoints, various data sources and multiple agents.An example of collaborative filtering can be to predict the rating of a particular user based on his/her ratings for other movies and others’ ratings for all movies. This concept is widely used in recommending movies in IMDB, Netflix & BookMyShow, product recommenders in e-commerce sites like Amazon, eBay & Flipkart, YouTube video recommendations and game recommendations in Xbox.",collabor filter
335,  How can outlier values be treated?,"Outlier values can be identified by using univariate or any other graphical analysis method. If the number of outlier values is few then they can be assessed individually but for a large number of outliers, the values can be substituted with either the 99th or the 1st percentile values.All extreme values are not outlier values. The most common ways to treat outlier valuesTo change the value and bring it within a range.To just remove the value.",outlier treat valu

This is an iterative step until the best possible outcome is achieved.Validate the model using a new data set.Start implementing the model and track the result to analyze the performance of the model over the period of time.",analyt involv project step variou
337,"  During analysis, how do you treat missing values?","The extent of the missing values is identified after identifying the variables with missing values. If any patterns are identified the analyst has to concentrate on them as it could lead to interesting and meaningful business insights.If there are no patterns identified, then the missing values can be substituted with mean or median values (imputation) or they can simply be ignored. Assigning a default value which can be mean, minimum or maximum value. Getting into the data is important.If it is a categorical variable, the default value is assigned. The missing value is assigned a default value. If you have a distribution of data coming, for normal distribution give the mean value.If 80% of the values for a variable are missing then you can answer that you would be dropping the variable instead of treating the missing values.",analysi miss treat valu
338,  How will you define the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm?,"Though the Clustering Algorithm is not specified, this question is mostly in reference to K-Means clustering where “K” defines the number of clusters. The objective of clustering is to group similar entities in a way that the entities within a group are similar to each other but the groups are different from each other.For example, the following image shows three different groups. Within Sum of squares is generally used to explain the homogeneity within a cluster. If you plot WSS for a range of number of clusters, you will get the plot shown below. The Graph is generally known as Elbow Curve.  Red circled a point in above graph i.e. Number of Cluster =6 is the point after which you don’t see any decrement in WSS.  This point is known as the bending point and taken as K in K – Means. The Graph is generally known as Elbow Curve.Red circled a point in above graph i.e. Number of Cluster =6 is the point after which you don’t see any decrement in WSS.This point is known as the bending point and taken as K in K – Means.This is the widely used approach but few data scientists also use Hierarchical clustering first to create dendrograms and identify the distinct groups from there.",cluster cluster

340,  Describe in brief any type of Ensemble Learning?,"Ensemble learning has many types but two more popular ensemble learning techniques are mentioned below.BaggingBagging tries to implement similar learners on small sample populations and then takes a mean of all the predictions. In generalised bagging, you can use different learners on different population. As you expect this helps us to reduce the variance error.BoostingBoosting is an iterative technique which adjusts the weight of an observation based on the last classification. If an observation was classified incorrectly, it tries to increase the weight of this observation and vice versa. Boosting in general decreases the bias error and builds strong predictive models. However, they may over fit on the training data.",ensembl learn type
341,  What is a Random Forest? How does it work?,"Random forest is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It is also used for dimensionality reduction, treats missing values, outlier values. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model.In Random Forest, we grow multiple trees as opposed to a single tree. To classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes(Overall the trees in the forest) and in case of regression, it takes the average of outputs by different trees.",forest random work
342,  How Do You Work Towards a Random Forest?,"The underlying principle of this technique is that several weak learners combined to provide a keen learner. The steps involved are Build several decision trees on bootstrapped training samples of data On each tree, each time a split is considered, a random sample of mm predictors is chosen as split candidates, out of all pp predictors Rule of thumb: At each split m=p√m=p Predictions: At the majority rule",forest random toward work
343,  What cross-validation technique would you use on a time series data set?,"Instead of using k-fold cross-validation, you should be aware of the fact that a time series is not randomly distributed data — It is inherently ordered by chronological order.In case of time series data, you should use techniques like forward=chaining — Where you will be model on past data then look at forward-facing data.fold 1: training[1], test[2]fold 1: training[1 2], test[3]fold 1: training[1 2 3], test[4]fold 1: training[1 2 3 4], test[5]",crossvalid data seri set techniqu time use would
344,  What is a Box-Cox Transformation?,"The dependent variable for a regression analysis might not satisfy one or more assumptions of an ordinary least squares regression. The residuals could either curve as the prediction increases or follow the skewed distribution. In such scenarios, it is necessary to transform the response variable so that the data meets the required assumptions. A Box cox transformation is a statistical technique to transform non-normal dependent variables into a normal shape. If the given data is not normal then most of the statistical techniques assume normality. Applying a box cox transformation means that you can run a broader number of tests.A Box-Cox transformation is a way to transform non-normal dependent variables into a normal shape. Normality is an important assumption for many statistical techniques, if your data isn’t normal, applying a Box-Cox means that you are able to run a broader number of tests.

Have you ever faced this kind of problem in your machine learning/data science experience so far?,"First of all, you have to ask which ML model you want to train.For Neural networks: Batch size with Numpy array will work.Steps:Load the whole data in the Numpy array. Numpy array has a property to create a mapping of the complete data set, it doesn’t load complete data set in memory.You can pass an index to Numpy array to get required data.Use this data to pass to the Neural network.Have a small batch size.For SVM: Partial fit will workSteps:Divide one big data set in small size data sets.Use a partial fit method of SVM, it requires a subset of the complete data set.Repeat step 2 for other subsets.However, you could actually face such an issue in reality.

348,  What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?,"Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning can be categorised in the following three categories.Supervised machine learning,Unsupervised machine learning,Reinforcement learningDeep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.",deep learn learn machin
349,"  What, in your opinion, is the reason for the popularity of Deep Learning in recent times?","Now although Deep Learning has been around for many years, the major breakthroughs from these techniques came just in recent years. This is because of two main reasons: The increase in the amount of data generated through various sources  The growth in hardware resources required to run these models The increase in the amount of data generated through various sourcesThe growth in hardware resources required to run these modelsGPUs are multiple times faster and they help us build bigger and deeper deep learning models in comparatively less time than we required previously. ",deep learn opinion popular reason recent time
350,  Explain Neural Network Fundamentals,"A neural network in data science aims to imitate a human brain neuron, where different neurons combine together and perform a task. It learns the generalizations or patterns from data and uses this knowledge to predict output for new data, without any human intervention.The simplest neural network can be a perceptron. It contains a single neuron, which performs the 2 operations, a weighted sum of all the inputs, and an activation function.More complicated neural networks consist of the following 3 layers-The figure below shows a neural network-",fundament network neural
351,  What is reinforcement learning?," Reinforcement Learning is learning what to do and how to map situations to actions. The end result is to maximise the numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which action to take but instead must discover which action will yield the maximum reward. Reinforcement learning is inspired by the learning of human beings, it is based on the reward/penalty mechanism.",learn reinforc
352,  What are Artificial Neural Networks?,Artificial Neural networks are a specific set of algorithms that have revolutionized machine learning. They are inspired by biological neural networks. Neural Networks can adapt to changing the input so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.,artifici network neural

354,  How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?,"There are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly.Initializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless.Initializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close to 0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the most commonly used method.",initi network weight
355,  What Is the Cost Function?,"Also referred to as “loss” or “error,” cost function is a measure to evaluate how good your model’s performance is. It’s used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation. We push that error backwards through the neural network and use that during the different training functions.",cost function
356,  What Are Hyperparameters?,"With neural networks, you’re usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted correctly. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a network is trained and the structure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, epochs, etc.).",hyperparamet
357,  What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set inaccurately (Too Low or Too High)?,"When your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal updates to the weights. It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point.If the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behaviour to the loss function due to drastic updates in weights. It may fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is too chaotic for the network to train).",happen high inaccur learn low rate set
358,"  What Is the Difference Between Epoch, Batch, and Iteration in Deep Learning?"," Epoch – Represents one iteration over the entire dataset (everything put into the training model).  Batch – Refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we divide the dataset into several batches.  Iteration – if we have 10,000 images as data and a batch size of 200. then an epoch should run 50 iterations (10,000 divided by 50). Epoch – Represents one iteration over the entire dataset (everything put into the training model).Batch – Refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we divide the dataset into several batches.Iteration – if we have 10,000 images as data and a batch size of 200. then an epoch should run 50 iterations (10,000 divided by 50).",batch deep epoch iter learn
359,  What Are the Different Layers on CNN?,"There are four layers in CNN:Convolutional Layer –  the layer that performs a convolutional operation, creating several smaller picture windows to go over the data.ReLU Layer – it brings non-linearity to the network and converts all the negative pixels to zero. The output is a rectified feature map.Pooling Layer – pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of the feature map.Fully Connected Layer – this layer recognizes and classifies the objects in the image.",cnn differ layer
360,"  What Is Pooling on CNN, and How Does It Work?",Pooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a CNN. It performs down-sampling operations to reduce the dimensionality and creates a pooled feature map by sliding a filter matrix over the input matrix.,cnn pool work
361,  What are Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs)?,"RNNs are a type of artificial neural networks designed to recognise the pattern from the sequence of data such as Time series, stock market and government agencies etc. To understand recurrent nets, first, you have to understand the basics of feedforward nets.Both these networks RNN and feed-forward named after the way they channel information through a series of mathematical orations performed at the nodes of the network. One feeds information through straight(never touching the same node twice), while the other cycles it through a loop, and the latter are called recurrent.Recurrent networks, on the other hand, take as their input, not just the current input example they see, but also the what they have perceived previously in time.The decision a recurrent neural network reached at time t-1 affects the decision that it will reach one moment later at time t. So recurrent networks have two sources of input, the present and the recent past, which combine to determine how they respond to new data, much as we do in life.The error they generate will return via backpropagation and be used to adjust their weights until error can’t go any lower. Remember, the purpose of recurrent nets is to classify sequential input accurately. We rely on the backpropagation of error and gradient descent to do so.",networksrnn neural recurr
362,  How Does an LSTM Network Work?,"Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a special kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies, remembering information for long periods as its default behaviour. There are three steps in an LSTM network: Step 1: The network decides what to forget and what to remember. Step 2: It selectively updates cell state values. Step 3: The network decides what part of the current state makes it to the output.",lstm network work
363,  What Is a Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP)?,"As in Neural Networks, MLPs have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It has the same structure as a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. A single layer perceptron can classify only linear separable classes with binary output (0,1), but MLP can classify nonlinear classes.Except for the input layer, each node in the other layers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the activation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output. MLP uses a supervised learning method called “backpropagation.” In backpropagation, the neural network calculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates this error backward from where it came (adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately).",multilay perceptronmlp
364,  How can time-series data be declared as stationery?,"When the key parameters of the time series data don’t vary with time, the time series is declared as stationary. These parameters may be mean or variance. There are no trends or seasonal effects in stationary times series. The Data science models need stationary time series data. The below figure shows a stationary time series.",data declar stationeri timeseri
365,  Explain Gradient Descent.,"To Understand Gradient Descent, Let’s understand what is a Gradient first.A gradient measures how much the output of a function changes if you change the inputs a little bit. It simply measures the change in all weights with regard to the change in error. You can also think of a gradient as the slope of a function.Gradient Descent can be thought of climbing down to the bottom of a valley, instead of climbing up a hill.  This is because it is a minimization algorithm that minimizes a given function (Activation Function).",descent gradient
366,  What is exploding gradients?,"While training an RNN, if you see exponentially growing (very large) error gradients which accumulate and result in very large updates to neural network model weights during training, they’re known as exploding gradients. At an extreme, the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in NaN values.This has the effect of your model is unstable and unable to learn from your training data.",explod gradient
367,  What is vanishing gradients?,"While training an RNN, your slope can become either too small; this makes the training difficult. The problem is known as a Vanishing Gradient when the slope is too small. It leads to long training times, poor performance, and low accuracy.",gradient vanish
368,  What is Back Propagation and Explain it’s Working.,"Backpropagation is a training algorithm used for multilayer neural network.

Without which the neural network would be only able to learn linear function which is a linear combination of its input data. An activation function is a function in an artificial neuron that delivers an output based on inputs.,activ function role
373,  What is an Auto-Encoder? ,"Auto-encoders are simple learning networks that aim to transform inputs into outputs with the minimum possible error. This means that we want the output to be as close to input as possible. We add a couple of layers between the input and the output, and the sizes of these layers are smaller than the input layer. The auto-encoder receives unlabelled input which is then encoded to reconstruct the input.",autoencod

The Boltzmann machine is basically used to optimise the weights and the quantity for the given problem. The learning algorithm is very slow in networks with many layers of feature detectors. “Restricted Boltzmann Machines” algorithm has a single layer of feature detectors which makes it faster than the rest.,boltzmann machin
375,  What Is Dropout and Batch Normalization?,Dropout is a technique of randomly dropping out hidden and visible units of a network to prevent overfitting of data (typically dropping 20 per cent of the nodes). It doubles the number of iterations needed to converge the network.Batch normalization is the technique to improve the performance and stability of neural networks by normalizing the inputs in every layer so that they have mean output activation of zero and standard deviation of one.,batch dropout normal
376,  What Is the Difference Between Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent?,"Batch Gradient DescentStochastic Gradient DescentThe batch gradient computes the gradient using the entire dataset.The stochastic gradient computes the gradient using a single sample.It takes time to converge because the volume of data is huge, and weights update slowly.It converges much faster than the batch gradient because it updates weight more frequently.",batch descent descent gradient gradient stochast

380,  What is a Generative Adversarial Network?,"Suppose there is a wine shop purchasing wine from dealers, which they resell later. But some dealers sell fake wine. In this case, the shop owner should be able to distinguish between fake and authentic wine.The forger will try different techniques to sell fake wine and make sure specific techniques go past the shop owner’s check. The shop owner would probably get some feedback from wine experts that some of the wine is not original. The owner would have to improve how he determines whether a wine is fake or authentic.The forger’s goal is to create wines that are indistinguishable from the authentic ones while the shop owner intends to tell if the wine is real or not accuratelyLet us understand this example with the help of an image.There is a noise vector coming into the forger who is generating fake wine.Here the forger acts as a Generator.The shop owner acts as a Discriminator.The Discriminator gets two inputs; one is the fake wine, while the other is the real authentic wine. The shop owner has to figure out whether it is real or fake.So, there are two primary components of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) named:GeneratorDiscriminatorThe generator is a CNN that keeps keys producing images and is closer in appearance to the real images while the discriminator tries to determine the difference between real and fake images The ultimate aim is to make the discriminator learn to identify real and fake images.Apart from the very technical questions, your interviewer could even hit you up with a few simple ones to check your overall confidence, in the likes of the following.",adversari gener network

382,  Is logistic regression a generative or a descriptive classifier? Why?,"Logistic regression is a descriptive model. Logistic regression learns to classify by knowing what features differentiate two or more classes of objects. For example, to classify between an apple and an orange, it will learn that the orange is orange in color and an apple is not. On the other hand, a generative classifier like a Naive Bayes will store all the classes' critical features and then classify based on the features the test case best fits.",classifi descript gener logist regress

390,  How many binary classifiers would you need to implement one-vs-all for three classes? How does it work?,"You would need three binary classifiers to implement one-vs-all for three classes since the number of binary classifiers is precisely equal to the number of classes with this approach. If you have three classes given by y=1, y=2, and y=3, then the three classifiers in the one-vs-all approach would consist of h(1)(x), which classifies the test cases as 1 or not 1, h(2)(x) which classifies the test cases as 2 or not 2 and so on. You can then take the results together to arrive at the correct classification. For example, with three categories, Cats, Dogs, and Rabbits, to implement the one-vs-all approach, we need to make the following comparisons:    Binary Classification Problem 1: Cats vs. Dogs, Rabbits (or not Cats)    Binary Classification Problem 2: Dogs vs. Cats, Rabbits (or not Dogs)    Binary Classification Problem 3: Rabbits vs. Cats, Dogs (or not Rabbits)Recommended Reading:                      Ed Godalle                                       Director Data Analytics at EY / EY Tech                                     Ray han                                       Tech Leader | Stanford / Yale University                         Not sure what you are looking for?

392,  What is the importance of regularisation? ,"Regularisation is a technique that can help alleviate the problem of overfitting a model. It is beneficial when a large number of parameters are present, which help predict the target function. In these circumstances, it is difficult to select which features to keep manually. Regularisation essentially involves adding coefficient terms to the cost function so that the terms are penalized and are small in magnitude. This helps, in turn, to preserve the overall trends in the data while not letting the model become too complex. These penalties, in effect, restrict the influence a predictor variable can have over the target by compressing the coefficients, thereby preventing overfitting. Explore Categories",import regularis
393,  Why is the Wald Test useful in logistic regression but not in linear regression? ,"The Wald test, also known as the Wald Chi-Squared Test, is a method to find whether the independent variables in a model are of significance. The significance of variables is decided by whether they contribute to the predictions or not. The variables that add no value to the model can therefore be deleted without risking severe adverse effects to the model. The Wald test is unnecessary in linear regression because it is easy to compare a more complicated model to a simpler model to check the influence of the added independent variables. After all, we can use the R2 value to make this comparison. However, this is not possible with logistic regression as we use Maximum Likelihood Estimate, which uses the previously mentioned method infeasible. The Wald test can be used for many different models, including those with binary variables or continuous variables, and has the added advantage that it only requires estimating one model.",linear logist regress regress test use wald

452, What is logistic regression and how is it used in machine learning? ,"Answer: Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems where the response variable is categorical with two possible outcomes (e.g., yes/no, true/false). Logistic regression finds the best fitting model so that it will describes the relationship between the predictor variables (input variable) and the binary response variable(target variable).In logistic regression, the response variable is transformed using a sigmoid function that maps the input to a probability between 0 and 1. The output of the model is interpreted as the probability of the positive class, and a decision threshold is used to classify new samples into the positive or negative class.Logistic regression can be used in various applications, such as predicting customer churn, detecting fraudulent transactions, or diagnosing diseases based on medical data.  ",learn logist machin regress
453, What are hyperparameters in machine learning? ,"Answer: Hyperparameters are parameters that are set prior to training a model and control its behavior during training. They are not learned from data and typically require manual tuning or optimization to achieve the best performance. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, regularization strength, number of hidden layers and neurons, batch size, and activation functions. ",hyperparamet learn machin
454, Why is hyperparameter tuning important in machine learning? ,"Answer: Hyperparameter tuning is important because it can significantly impact the performance of a machine-learning model. Choosing the wrong hyperparameters can lead to overfitting, underfitting, or poor generalization, which can result in inaccurate predictions and wasted resources. By tuning the hyperparameters, we can find the optimal settings that result in the best performance on the validation or test set. ",hyperparamet import learn machin tune
455, What are some methods for hyperparameter tuning? ,"Answer: There are several methods for hyperparameter tuning, including: Grid search: Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique that involves defining a set of values for each hyperparameter and systematically evaluating all possible combinations of these values to determine the best configuration for the model. Random Search: This involves randomly sampling hyperparameter values from predefined distributions to explore the hyperparameter space more efficiently. Bayesian optimization: This involves using a probabilistic model to predict the performance of different hyperparameter settings and selecting the most promising ones to evaluate. Genetic algorithms: This involves using evolutionary algorithms to search the hyperparameter space by generating and evaluating candidate solutions based on their fitness.  ",hyperparamet method tune
456, How can we avoid overfitting during hyperparameter tuning? ,"Answer: Overfitting can occur during hyperparameter tuning if we evaluate the performance of the model too many times on the same validation set, leading to over-optimistic estimates of the performance. To avoid overfitting, we can use techniques such as cross-validation or holdout validation, where we split the data into training, validation, and test sets, and only use the test set for the final evaluation. We can also use regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.  What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in machine learning? Answer: KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

This assumption is often not true in practice, but Naive Bayes can still perform well if the features are only weakly correlated. ",assumpt bay naiv
461, Why naive Bayes algorithm is called naïve? ,"Answer: Naive Bayes algorithm is called “naive” because of its strong assumption of feature independence, which is often unrealistic in real-world data. The algorithm assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label, meaning that the presence or absence of one feature does not affect the probability of the other features. This assumption is naive because it ignores the correlations between the features, which may not be true in practice. ",bay call naiv naïv
462, What is a decision tree and how does it work? ," Answer: A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used for classification and regression problems.

Features that result in the largest decrease in impurity are considered the most important. ",determin featur forest import random
468, What are entropy and Gini impurity? ,"Answer: Entropy is a measure of impurity that calculates the amount of disorder or randomness in the data. In other words, it measures how much uncertainty or surprise there is in the data. Entropy is calculated as follows:                                 Entropy = -∑(p(i) log2 p(i))                                 where p(i) is the proportion of samples in class i.Gini impurity, on the other hand, measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen sample from the data set. It is calculated as follows:                               Gini impurity = 1 – ∑(p(i)^2)                               where p(i) is the proportion of samples in class i.Both entropy and Gini impurity are used in the decision tree algorithm to determine the best feature to split the data into classes. The feature that results in the lowest impurity (i.e., the highest information gain) is chosen as the split criterion.  How to do pruning in Decision Tree and what are the types of pruning Answer: Pruning is a technique used in decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. It involves removing branches from the tree that do not contribute much to the overall accuracy of the model. Here are the basic steps involved in pruning a decision tree:Pruning is classified into pre-pruning and post-pruning. Pre-pruning involves stopping the growth of the tree early before it becomes too complex. Post-pruning involves growing a full decision tree and then removing unnecessary branches.Common methods for post-pruning include reduced error pruning, cost complexity pruning, and minimum description length (MDL) pruning. ",entropi gini impur

474,  What is the role of support vectors in SVM? ,"Answer: Support vectors are the data points closest to the decision boundary of an SVM model. They play a crucial role in defining the decision boundary and maximizing the margin between the two classes.   What is the difference between hard-margin and soft-margin SVM? Answer: The hard margin SVM attempts to find a decision boundary that completely separates the two classes. In contrast, the soft margin SVM permits some misclassifications and determines a decision boundary that maximizes the margin while minimizing the misclassification error.   Explain the difference between linear and non-linear SVM. Answer: Linear SVM uses a linear decision boundary to separate the two classes, while non-linear SVM uses a non-linear decision boundary to separate the two classes. Non-linear SVM achieves this by transforming the input data into a higher dimensional space where it is more likely to be linearly separable. ",role support svm vector

488,  What are some popular deep learning frameworks? ,"Answer: Some popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Caffe.   What is backpropagation, and how is it used in deep learning? Answer: Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train artificial neural networks in deep learning. It involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the neural network and using this gradient to update the parameters using gradient descent. Backpropagation is used to optimize the weights and biases of the neural network during the training process.   What is a convolutional neural network, and how is it used in deep learning? Answer: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is primarily utilized for tasks related to image recognition and belongs to the category of neural networks. CNNs use a process called convolution, which involves sliding a small window (known as a filter or kernel) over the input image and calculating a dot product between the filter and the corresponding pixels in the image. This process generates a feature map, which is then passed through a nonlinear activation function. The resulting output is then fed into another convolutional layer or a fully connected layer for further processing.     What is a recurrent neural network, and how is it used in deep learning? Answer: A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network that is used primarily for sequential data processing tasks, such as speech recognition and natural language processing. RNNs use feedback connections to allow information to persist across time steps, which enables them to process sequences of arbitrary length. RNNs can be trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which involves unrolling the network over time and applying backpropagation through time (BPTT) to update the weights and biases.   What is transfer learning, and how is it used in deep learning? Answer: Transfer learning is a technique employed in deep learning, wherein a pre-trained model serves as an initial point for a new task. The pre-trained model has already been trained on a large dataset, which means it has learned to recognize many different features. By using a pre-trained model as a starting point, the new model can learn to recognize new features more quickly and with less data. Transfer learning is especially useful when working with small datasets, as it can help prevent overfitting.   What is a dropout, and how is it used in deep learning? Answer: Dropout is a technique that is important in deep learning to avoid overfitting We are going to drop out (setting to zero) some fraction of the input units during training time. This forces the network to learn redundant representations of the input, which can improve its generalization performance. Dropout can be thought of as a form of ensemble learning, where multiple models are trained on different subsets of the data and combined at test time. ",deep framework learn popular

499,  Difference between linear regression and logistic regression? ,"Answer:          What is the difference between precision and recall, and when are they important to consider in a classification problem? Can you provide some examples of situations where a false positive or a false negative could be costly, and explain why precision or recall, respectively, is important in those cases? Answer: Precision and recall are both important metrics in evaluating the performance of classification models.Precision measures the proportion of true positives (i.e., the cases that were correctly classified as positive) among all positive predictions made by the model. In other words, it measures how accurate the model is when it predicts that a certain case belongs to the positive class.  Give importance on precision when the cost of a false positive is high. For example:In medical diagnosis, a false positive (predicting that a patient has a disease when they actually don’t) could lead to unnecessary treatments and procedures that are costly and potentially harmful.In credit fraud detection, a false positive (flagging a legitimate transaction as fraudulent) could result in blocking a legitimate purchase, which can negatively impact the customer experience and cause inconvenience.Recall means total true positives predicated cases among all actual positive cases. In other words, it measures how well the model identifies all the positive cases. Recall is important when the cost of a false negative is high. For example:In medical diagnosis, a false negative (failing to diagnose a disease in a patient who actually has it) could delay treatment and lead to further complications or even death.In spam email detection, a false negative (failing to flag a spam email as spam) could result in the user receiving unwanted emails, which can be a nuisance and potentially harmful if the email contains malicious content.In summary, precision is important when the cost of a false positive is high, while recall is important when the cost of a false negative is high. In practice, the choice of which metric to prioritize depends on the specific context and goals of the classification problem. ",linear logist regress regress
500, What are some common challenges of working with big data? ," Answer: Some common challenges of working with big data include data quality issues, processing and storage limitations, privacy and security concerns, and the need for specialized skills and tools.  In a classification problem with imbalanced classes, where the majority class makes up 90% of the data and the minority class makes up 10%, a machine learning model achieves an accuracy score of 90%. Is this model good enough to deploy in a real-world scenario? Why or why not?? Answer: While an accuracy score of 90% may seem high at first glance, it can be misleading in cases of imbalanced classes. In this scenario, a model that simply classifies all instances as the majority class (i.e., without any actual learning taking place) would achieve an accuracy score of 90%, but it would be useless for practical purposes.In such cases, it is important to look beyond accuracy and consider other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which take into account the true positive rate and false positive rate for each class. For example, if the minority class is the one that is of greater interest, achieving high recall for that class may be more important than overall accuracy.Furthermore, it may be necessary to use techniques such as oversampling or undersampling of the minority class, or the use of more advanced algorithms such as ensemble methods, to improve the model’s performance on the minority class  Suppose you are working on an anomaly detection problem where the goal is to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. The dataset contains 100,000 transactions, of which only 1,000 (1%) are labelled as fraud. You decide to use an unsupervised learning approach with a one-class support vector machine (SVM) to detect anomalies in the dataset. After training the model, you obtain a precision of 90% and a recall of 70% on the fraud class. Is this model likely to perform well on new, unseen data? Why or why not? Answer: In this scenario, the one-class SVM model achieved a relatively high precision of 90%, meaning that out of all transactions that the model classified as fraud, 90% were actually fraudulent. However, the recall of 70% indicates that the model missed 30% of the actual fraud transactions, which is a relatively high false negative rate.Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, achieving a high precision is important to minimize false positives, which would be flagged as potential fraud and require further investigation. However, missing actual fraud transactions is still a significant issue, and a high precision score does not necessarily imply good performance on new, unseen data.Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the one-class SVM model is likely to perform well on new, unseen data without further evaluation. It may be necessary to explore other evaluation metrics, such as the F1 score or the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and consider the specific context and cost associated with false positives and false negatives. ",big challeng common data work
501, What are some examples of when to remove or keep outliers in machine learning? Why is it important to investigate outliers carefully before deciding whether to remove them or not?  ,"Answer: Here are some examples of when to remove or keep outliers in machine learning:Regression: In linear regression, outliers can have a significant impact on the slope of the regression line and the accuracy of the model. In this case, it may be appropriate to investigate the outliers and consider removing them if they are found to be spurious or erroneous.Technical errors: In some cases, outliers may be the result of technical errors, such as data entry mistakes or system glitches. In this case, it may be appropriate to remove the outliers or correct the errors to ensure the accuracy of the model.Financial data: Suppose a company is analysing the stock price of a particular stock over a period of time. The dataset contains a few extreme values that are much higher or lower than the rest of the data. In this case, it may be appropriate to keep the outliers and investigate their potential causes (e.g., unexpected market events or corporate announcements) to gain insights into the underlying trends and patterns in the data.Fraudulent transactions: In credit fraud detection, transactions that are significantly different from the typical transaction patterns of a customer or a group of customers may be flagged as potential outliers. In this case, it may be appropriate to keep the outliers and investigate them further to determine whether they represent fraudulent activity.Legitimate but unusual transactions: Some legitimate transactions may be flagged as outliers due to their unusual nature, such as large purchases or overseas transactions. In this case, it may be appropriate to keep the outliers and investigate them further to ensure that they are legitimate. ",care decid exampl import investig keep learn machin outlier outlier remov remov whether

508, What is topic modeling in NLP? ,"Answer: Topic modeling is the process of identifying and extracting topics or themes from a large corpus of text data. Topic modeling is useful in NLP because it helps us to understand the main themes and ideas in a text.                                Suppose you have 80 balls, consisting of 40 red balls and 40 blue balls, and two buckets. You can distribute the balls between the buckets in any way you like, with the aim of maximizing the probability of selecting a red ball if you choose one ball at random from one of the buckets. How should you distribute the balls to achieve this goal? Answer: To maximize the probability of selecting a red ball if we choose one ball at random from one of the buckets, we should put one red ball in one bucket and the remaining balls in the other bucket. This will result in a probability of 74.4% of selecting a red ball if we choose one ball at random from one of the buckets. This is higher than the probability of 50% if we put all the red balls in one bucket and all the blue balls in the other bucket.The probability of selecting a red ball from the bucket with only one red ball is 1/2 because there are a total of 2 balls in that bucket. The probability of selecting a red ball from the other bucket is 39/79 because there are 39 red balls and 40 blue balls in that bucket.The overall probability of selecting a red ball is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is:   (1/2) * 1 + (1/2) * (39/79) = 0.7437 or approximately 74.4%   Suppose We have an hourly temperature of the city that you live in. We have gathered data over several years would random sampling be a good strategy to use if we want to work with a sample of the dataset? if yes why? if not why? Answer: No, random sampling would not be an appropriate strategy to use if you want to work with a sample of the dataset of hourly temperature data over several years for the city you live in. The reason for this is that the hourly temperature data is likely to be correlated over time, meaning that each data point is influenced by the previous ones. Random sampling assumes that each data point is independent of the others, which is not the case in this scenario. Instead, you could consider using time-based sampling, where you take a sample at regular intervals throughout the time period you are interested in. This would allow you to capture the trends and patterns in the data over time, which would not be possible with random sampling.Alternatively, you could consider using stratified sampling, where you divide the data into groups based on relevant characteristics (e.g., seasons, time of day, etc.) and then take a sample from each group. This would allow you to capture the variability in the data across different groups and ensure that your sample is representative of the entire dataset. ",model nlp topic
509, What are the characteristics of a normal distribution with respect to its standard deviation? ,"Answer: The normal distribution is a bell-shaped probability distribution that is symmetric around its mean. It is characterized by two parameters: its mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ). The standard deviation measures the amount of variability or dispersion of the data from the mean. Here are some characteristics of the normal distribution with respect to its standard deviation:1) The standard deviation determines the shape of the normal curve. The standard deviation measures the amount of variability or dispersion of the data from the mean. When the standard deviation is small, it means that the data points are tightly clustered around the mean. This results in a probability distribution curve that is tall and narrow. On the other hand, when the standard deviation is large, it means that the data points are more spread out from the mean. This results in a probability distribution curve that is short and wide. 2) If the data follows a normal distribution, we can expect that roughly 68% of the data points will be within one standard deviation of the mean, while about 95% of the data points will be within two standard deviations of the mean, and approximately 99.7% of the data points will be within three standard deviations of the mean. 3) The standard deviation is used to calculate the Z-score, which is a measure of how many standard deviations a particular data point is from the mean. 4) The standard deviation can be used to calculate confidence intervals, which are a range of values that are likely to contain the true population mean with a certain level of confidence.Overall, the standard deviation is a very important parameter of the normal distribution, as it helps to describe the spread and shape of the distribution, and allows for the calculation of various statistical measures.  Tell me the difference between correlation and covariance. Answer:           We want a model which predicts whether it is going to rain the next day so model has two classes No rain(negative class or class 0) and Rain (positive class or class 1) The model will be deployed in a region where it hardly rains on the average it rains 1 day out of 100 The model predicts every time it will not rain .What is model accuracy what is precision and recall discuss model is useful or not ? Answer: Given the problem statement,Positive class (Rain) = Class 1Negative class (No rain) = Class 0P(Rain) = 0.01, P(No rain) = 0.99If the model always predicts that it will not rain, it will be correct 99% of the time (the negative class accuracy). However, this is not a useful metric in this case, as we are more interested in the performance of the model in predicting the positive class (Rain).      Accuracy = (True positives + True negatives) / Total predictions = (0 + 99) / 100 = 99%Precision = True positives / (True positives + False positives) = 0 / (0 + 1) = 0%Recall (Sensitivity) = True positives / (True positives + False negatives) = 0 / (0 + 1) = 0%The accuracy of the model is very high (99%), but this is misleading because the model is not able to correctly predict any instances of the positive class. The precision and recall of the model for the positive class are both zero, indicating that the model is unable to correctly identify any instances of the positive class. In this case, the model is not useful because it is not able to correctly identify instances of the positive class, which is the class of interest. While the model has a high accuracy for the negative class, this is not a useful metric in this context. A useful model should have higher precision and recall for the positive class, even if this comes at the cost of lower overall accuracy. ",characterist deviat distribut normal standard
510, What is data augmentation? ,"Answer: Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying various transformations to the original images, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This can help to improve the generalization performance of a CNN. ",augment data
511, What are the challenges associated with CNNs? ,"Answer: One challenge with CNNs is that they can be computationally expensive to train and run, particularly for large datasets. Another challenge is that they can be prone to overfitting, where the network memorizes the training data rather than generalizing to new data. ",associ challeng cnn
512, What is backpropagation? ,Answer: Backpropagation is a mathematical algorithm used to train ANNs by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the network. It allows the network to learn from its mistakes and adjust its parameters to improve its predictions. ,backpropag
513, What is a hypothesis test in statistics? ,Answer: A hypothesis test in statistics is a method of using sample data to make inferences about the population from which the sample was drawn. It involves formulating a hypothesis about the population and testing whether the sample data supports or contradicts that hypothesis.  ,hypothesi statist test
514, What is the central limit theorem in statistics? ,Answer: The central limit theorem in statistics is a fundamental concept that states that the sampling distribution of the mean of a sufficiently large sample drawn from any population will be approximately normal without consideration of the shape of the population distribution. ,central limit statist theorem
515, What is a confidence interval in statistics? ,"Answer: confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for an unknown population parameter, based on a sample of data.  The confidence interval represents the range of values that we can be reasonably confident contains the true population parameter.                                         ",confid interv statist
516, What is ANOVA in statistics? ,"Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified. ",anova statist
