In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

It doesn’t capture causality. It is visualized by a single point.Regression: It measures how one variable affects another variable. Regression is all about model fitting. It tries to capture the causality and describes the cause and the effect. It is visualized by a regression line.  \n",
       "4                                                                                   Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)  "

R square indicates the variation of all the independent variables on the dependent variable. i.e. it considers all the independent variable to explain the variation. In the case of Adjusted R squared, it considers only significant variables(P values less than 0.05) to indicate the percentage of variation in the model.  \n",

So, if you just want predictions, the presence of multicollinearity does not affect your output.

Also, it should not be much affected by the outliers. \\nA regression model with OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is quite sensitive to the outliers. To overcome this problem, we can use the WLS (Weighted Least Squares) method to determine the estimators of the regression coefficients. Here, less weights are given to the outliers or high leverage points in the fitting, making these points less impactful. ',\n",
       " '22. Which graphs are suggested to be observed before model fitting?',\n",
       " 'Before fitting the model, one must be well aware of the data, such as what the trends, distribution, skewness, etc. in the variables are. Graphs such as histograms, box plots, and dot plots can be used to observe the distribution of the variables. Apart from this, one must also analyse what the relationship between dependent and independent variables is. This can be done by scatter plots (in case of univariate problems), rotating plots, dynamic plots, etc.',\n",

       " 'The generalized linear model is the derivative of the ordinary linear regression model. GLM is more flexible in terms of residuals and can be used where linear regression does not seem appropriate. GLM allows the distribution of residuals to be other than a normal distribution. It generalizes the linear regression by allowing the linear model to link to the target variable using the linking function. Model estimation is done using the method of maximum likelihood estimation.',\n",

If the value is too small, the gradient descent algorithm takes ages to converge to the optimal solution. On the other hand, if the value of the learning rate is high, the gradient descent will overshoot the optimal solution and most likely never converge to the optimal solution.To overcome this problem, you can try different values of alpha over a range of values and plot the cost vs the number of iterations. Then, based on the graphs, the value corresponding to the graph showing the rapid decrease can be chosen.\\n\\nThe aforementioned graph is an ideal cost vs the number of iterations curve. Note that the cost initially decreases as the number of iterations increases, but after certain iterations, the gradient descent converges and the cost does not decrease anymore.If you see that the cost is increasing with the number of iterations, your learning rate parameter is high and it needs to be decreased.\\n  "

Doing this for a 300 x 300 pixel image would mean dividing the matrix into smaller 3 x 3 matrices and dealing with them one by one. This is convolution.',\n",

       "      <td>The key here is to make the explanation as simple as possible. As we know, the gradient descent algorithm tries to minimize the error by taking small steps towards the minimum value. These steps are used to update the weights and biases in a neural network.However, at times, the steps become too large and this results in larger updates to weights and bias terms – so much so as to cause an overflow (or a NaN) value in the weights. This leads to an unstable algorithm and is called an exploding gradient.On the other hand, the steps are too small and this leads to minimal changes in the weights and bias terms – even negligible changes at times. We thus might end up training a deep learning model with almost the same weights and biases each time and never reach the minimum error function. This is called the vanishing gradient.A point to note is that both these issues are specifically evident in Recurrent Neural Networks – so be prepared for follow-up questions on RNN!</td>\n",

       "      <td>I am sure you would have a doubt as to why a relatively simple question was included in the Intermediate Level. The reason is the sheer volume of subsequent questions it can generate!The use of transfer learning has been one of the key milestones in deep learning. Training a large model on a huge dataset, and then using the final parameters on smaller simpler datasets has led to defining breakthroughs in the form of Pretrained Models. Be it Computer Vision or NLP, pretrained models have become the norm in research and in the industry.Some popular examples include BERT, ResNet, GPT-2, VGG-16, etc and many more.It is here that you can earn brownie points by pointing out specific examples/projects where you used these models and how you used them as well.It is not possible to discuss all of them, so here are a few resources to get started:It is here that questions become really specific to your projects or to what you have discussed in the interview before.Also, depending on the domain – with Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing, these questions can change. While it is not important to know the architecture of each model in detail, you would need to know the intuition behind them and why these models were needed in the first place.Again, just like the intermediate level, it is important to always bring in examples that you have studied or implemented yourself into the discussion.</td>\n",

You can start off by giving a simple explanation of how neural networks are built:Step 1: Calculate the sum of all the inputs (X) according to their weights and include the bias term:Z = (weights * X) + biasStep 2: Apply an activation function to calculate the expected output:Y = Activation(Z)Steps 1 and 2 are performed at each layer. If you recollect, this is nothing but forward propagation! Now, what if there is no activation function?Our equation for Y essentially becomes:Y = Z = (weights * X) + biasWait – isn’t this just a simple linear equation? Yes – and that is why we need activation functions. A linear equation will not be able to capture the complex patterns in the data – this is even more evident in the case of deep learning problems.In order to capture non-linear relationships, we use activation functions, and that is why a neural network without an activation function is just a linear regression model.  \n",

While this might work during forward propagation, the derivative of the cost function during backward propagation would be the same every time.In short, there is no learning happening by the network! What do you call the phenomenon of the model being unable to learn any patterns from the data? Yes, underfitting.Therefore, if all weights have the same initial value, this would lead to underfitting.Note: This question might further lead to questions on exploding and vanishing gradients, which I have covered below.  \n",

Consider that you want to go out today to play a cricket match with your friends. Now, a number of factors can affect your decision-making, like:And so on. These factors can change your decision greatly or not too much. For example, if it is raining outside, then you cannot go out to play at all. Or if you have only one bat, you can share it while playing as well. The magnitude by which these factors can affect the game is called the weight of that factor.Factors like the weather or temperature might have a higher weight, and other factors like equipment would have a lower weight.However, does this mean that we can play a cricket match with only one bat? No – we would need 1 ball and 6 wickets as well. This is where bias comes into the picture. Bias lets you assign some threshold which helps you activate a decision-point (or a neuron) only when that threshold is crossed.  \n",

If you are on a phone interview, you cannot perform all the calculus in writing and show the interviewer. In such cases, it best to explain it as such:For an in-person interview, it is best to take up the marker, create a simple neural network with 2 inputs, a hidden layer, and an output layer, and explain it.Forward propagation:Backpropagation:At layer L2, for all weights:At layer L1, for all weights:You need not explain with respect to the bias term as well, though you might need to expand the above equations substituting the actual derivatives.  \n",

Just like normalizing our input helps improve our logistic regression model, we can normalize the activations of the hidden layers in our deep learning model as well:We basically normalize a[1] and a[2] here. This means we normalize the inputs to the layer, and then apply the activation functions to the normalized inputs.Here is an article that explains Batch Normalization and other techniques for improving Neural Networks: Neural Networks – Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization & Optimization.  \n",

Unlike humans, the machine sees the image as a matrix of pixel values. Instead of interpreting a shape like a petal or an ear, it just identifies curves and edges.Thus, instead of looking at the entire image, it helps to just read the image in parts. Doing this for a 300 x 300 pixel image would mean dividing the matrix into smaller 3 x 3 matrices and dealing with them one by one. This is convolution.Mathematically, we just perform a small operation on the matrix to help us detect features in the image – like boundaries, colors, etc.Z = X * fHere, we are convolving (* operation – not multiplication) the input matrix X with another small matrix f, called the kernel/filter to create a new matrix Z. This matrix is then passed on to the other layers.If you have a board/screen in front of you, you can always illustrate this with a simple example:Learning more about how CNNs work here.  \n",

This loop brings the recurrence mechanism in RNNs. In a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN), each input is given the same weight and fed to the network at the same time. So, for a sentence like “I saw the movie and hated it”, it would be difficult to capture the information which associates “it” with the “movie”.The addition of a loop is to denote preserving the previous node’s information for the next node, and so on. This is why RNNs are much better for sequential data, and since text data also is sequential in nature, they are an improvement over ANNs.   \n",

As we know, the gradient descent algorithm tries to minimize the error by taking small steps towards the minimum value. These steps are used to update the weights and biases in a neural network.However, at times, the steps become too large and this results in larger updates to weights and bias terms – so much so as to cause an overflow (or a NaN) value in the weights. This leads to an unstable algorithm and is called an exploding gradient.On the other hand, the steps are too small and this leads to minimal changes in the weights and bias terms – even negligible changes at times. We thus might end up training a deep learning model with almost the same weights and biases each time and never reach the minimum error function. This is called the vanishing gradient.A point to note is that both these issues are specifically evident in Recurrent Neural Networks – so be prepared for follow-up questions on RNN!  \n",
       "15  I am sure you would have a doubt as to why a relatively simple question was included in the Intermediate Level. The reason is the sheer volume of subsequent questions it can generate!The use of transfer learning has been one of the key milestones in deep learning. Training a large model on a huge dataset, and then using the final parameters on smaller simpler datasets has led to defining breakthroughs in the form of Pretrained Models. Be it Computer Vision or NLP, pretrained models have become the norm in research and in the industry.Some popular examples include BERT, ResNet, GPT-2, VGG-16, etc and many more.It is here that you can earn brownie points by pointing out specific examples/projects where you used these models and how you used them as well.It is not possible to discuss all of them, so here are a few resources to get started:It is here that questions become really specific to your projects or to what you have discussed in the interview before.Also, depending on the domain – with Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing, these questions can change. While it is not important to know the architecture of each model in detail, you would need to know the intuition behind them and why these models were needed in the first place.Again, just like the intermediate level, it is important to always bring in examples that you have studied or implemented yourself into the discussion.  \n",

The problems of vanishing gradients and exploding gradients we saw earlier are a disadvantage while using the plain RNN model.In LSTMs, we add a forget gate, which is basically a memory unit that retains information that is retained across timesteps and discards the other information that is not needed. This also necessitates the need for input and output gates to include the results of the forget gate as well.  \n",

In order to still retain the functionality of retaining information across time and yet not make a too complex model, we need GRUs.Basically, in GRUs, instead of having an additional Forget gate, we combine the input and Forget gates into a single Update Gate:It is this reduction in the number of gates that makes GRU less complex and faster than LSTM.

       " 'If you are going for a deep learning interview, you definitely know what exactly deep learning is. However, with this question the interviewee expects you to give an in-detail answer, with an example.\\xa0Deep Learning involves taking large volumes of structured or unstructured data and using complex algorithms to train neural networks. It performs complex operations to extract hidden patterns and features (for instance, distinguishing the image of a cat from that of a dog).',\n",

       " 'Neural Networks replicate the way humans learn, inspired by how the neurons in our brains fire, only much simpler.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'The most common Neural Networks consist of three network layers:',\n",
       " 'Each sheet contains neurons called “nodes,” performing various operations. Neural Networks are used in deep learning algorithms like CNN, RNN, GAN, etc.',\n",
       " '3. What Is a Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP)?',\n",
       " 'As in Neural Networks, MLPs have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It has the same\\xa0structure as a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. A single layer perceptron can classify only linear separable classes with binary output (0,1), but MLP can classify nonlinear classes.',\n",
       " 'Except for the input layer, each node in the other layers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the activation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output. MLP uses a supervised learning method called “backpropagation.” In backpropagation, the neural network calculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates this error backward from where it came (adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately).',\n",
       " '4. What Is Data Normalization, and Why Do We Need It?',\n",
       " 'The process of standardizing and reforming data is called “Data Normalization.” It’s a pre-processing step to eliminate data redundancy. Often, data comes in, and you get the same information in different formats. In these cases, you should rescale values to fit into a particular range, achieving better convergence.',\n",
       " '5. What is the Boltzmann Machine?',\n",
       " 'One of the most basic Deep Learning models is a Boltzmann Machine, resembling a simplified version of the Multi-Layer Perceptron. This model features a visible input layer and a hidden layer -- just a two-layer neural net that makes stochastic decisions as to whether a neuron should be on or off. Nodes are connected across layers, but no two nodes of the same layer are connected.',\n",
       " '6. What Is the Role of Activation Functions in a Neural Network?',\n",
       " 'At the most basic level, an activation function decides whether a neuron should be fired or not. It accepts the weighted sum of the inputs and bias as input to any activation function. Step function, Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, and Softmax are examples of activation functions.',\n",

       " 'Also referred to as “loss” or “error,” cost function is a measure to evaluate how good your model’s performance is. It’s used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation. We push that error backward through the neural network and use that during the different training functions.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '8. What Is Gradient Descent?',\n",
       " 'Gradient Descent is an optimal algorithm to minimize the cost function or to minimize an error. The aim is to find the local-global minima of a function. This determines the direction the model should take to reduce the error.',\n",

       " '13. What Are Hyperparameters?',\n",
       " 'This is another frequently asked deep learning interview question. With neural networks, you’re usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted correctly. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a network is trained and the structure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, epochs, etc.).',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '14. What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set Too Low or Too High?',\n",

       " 'If the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behavior to the loss function due to drastic updates in weights. It may fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is too chaotic for the network to train).',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '15. What Is Dropout and Batch Normalization?',\n",
       " 'Dropout is a technique of dropping out hidden and visible units of a network randomly to prevent overfitting of data (typically dropping 20 percent of the nodes). It doubles the number of iterations needed to converge the network.',\n",

       " '17. What is Overfitting and Underfitting, and How to Combat Them?',\n",
       " \"Overfitting occurs when the model learns the details and noise in the training data to the degree that it adversely impacts the execution of the model on new information. It is more likely to occur with nonlinear models that have more flexibility when learning a target function. An example would be if a model is looking at cars and trucks, but only recognizes trucks that have a specific box shape. It might not be able to notice a flatbed truck because there's only a particular kind of truck it saw in training. The model performs well on training data, but not in the real world.\",\n",
       " 'Underfitting alludes to a model that is neither well-trained on data nor can generalize to new information. This usually happens when there is less and incorrect data to train a model. Underfitting has both poor performance and accuracy.',\n",
       " 'To combat overfitting and underfitting, you can resample the data to estimate the model accuracy (k-fold cross-validation) and by having a validation dataset to evaluate the model.',\n",
       " '18. How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?',\n",
       " 'There are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly.',\n",
       " 'Initializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless.',\n",
       " 'Initializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close to 0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the most commonly used method.',\n",

       "      <td>Selection bias is a kind of error that occurs when the researcher decides who is going to be studied. It is usually associated with research where the selection of participants isn’t random. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect. It is the distortion of statistical analysis, resulting from the method of collecting samples. If the selection bias is not taken into account, then some conclusions of the study may not be accurate.The types of selection bias include:Sampling bias: It is a systematic error due to a non-random sample of a population causing some members of the population to be less likely to be included than others resulting in a biased sample.Time interval: A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for ethical reasons), but the extreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance, even if all variables have a similar mean.Data: When specific subsets of data are chosen to support a conclusion or rejection of bad data on arbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria.Attrition: Attrition bias is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants) discounting trial subjects/tests that did not run to completion.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bias: Bias is an error introduced in your model due to the oversimplification of the machine learning algorithm. It can lead to underfitting. When you train your model at that time model makes simplified assumptions to make the target function easier to understand.Low bias machine learning algorithms — Decision Trees, k-NN and SVM High bias machine learning algorithms — Linear Regression, Logistic RegressionVariance: Variance is error introduced in your model due to a complex machine learning algorithm, your model learns noise also from the training data set and performs badly on test data set. It can lead to high sensitivity and overfitting.Normally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in error due to lower bias in the model. However, this only happens until a particular point. As you continue to make your model more complex, you end up over-fitting your model and hence your model will start suffering from high variance.Bias-Variance trade-off: The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to have low bias and low variance to achieve good prediction performance.The k-nearest neighbour algorithm has low bias and high variance, but the trade-off can be changed by increasing the value of k which increases the number of neighbours that contribute to the prediction and in turn increases the bias of the model.The support vector machine algorithm has low bias and high variance, but the trade-off can be changed by increasing the C parameter that influences the number of violations of the margin allowed in the training data which increases the bias but decreases the variance.There is no escaping the relationship between bias and variance in machine learning. Increasing the bias will decrease the variance. Increasing the variance will decrease bias.ChatGPT Tutorial | ChatGPT Explained | What is ChatGPT ? | Edureka This 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐆𝐏𝐓 𝐓𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 is intended as a Crash Course on 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐆𝐏𝐓 for Beginners.

It is usually associated with research where the selection of participants isn’t random. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect. It is the distortion of statistical analysis, resulting from the method of collecting samples. If the selection bias is not taken into account, then some conclusions of the study may not be accurate.The types of selection bias include:Sampling bias: It is a systematic error due to a non-random sample of a population causing some members of the population to be less likely to be included than others resulting in a biased sample.Time interval: A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for ethical reasons), but the extreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance, even if all variables have a similar mean.Data: When specific subsets of data are chosen to support a conclusion or rejection of bad data on arbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria.Attrition: Attrition bias is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants) discounting trial subjects/tests that did not run to completion.  \n",
       "2  Bias: Bias is an error introduced in your model due to the oversimplification of the machine learning algorithm. It can lead to underfitting. When you train your model at that time model makes simplified assumptions to make the target function easier to understand.Low bias machine learning algorithms — Decision Trees, k-NN and SVM High bias machine learning algorithms — Linear Regression, Logistic RegressionVariance: Variance is error introduced in your model due to a complex machine learning algorithm, your model learns noise also from the training data set and performs badly on test data set. It can lead to high sensitivity and overfitting.Normally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in error due to lower bias in the model. However, this only happens until a particular point. As you continue to make your model more complex, you end up over-fitting your model and hence your model will start suffering from high variance.Bias-Variance trade-off: The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to have low bias and low variance to achieve good prediction performance.The k-nearest neighbour algorithm has low bias and high variance, but the trade-off can be changed by increasing the value of k which increases the number of neighbours that contribute to the prediction and in turn increases the bias of the model.The support vector machine algorithm has low bias and high variance, but the trade-off can be changed by increasing the C parameter that influences the number of violations of the margin allowed in the training data which increases the bias but decreases the variance.There is no escaping the relationship between bias and variance in machine learning. Increasing the bias will decrease the variance. Increasing the variance will decrease bias.ChatGPT Tutorial | ChatGPT Explained | What is ChatGPT ? | Edureka This 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐆𝐏𝐓 𝐓𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 is intended as a Crash Course on 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐆𝐏𝐓 for Beginners.

Logistic regression should be the first thing to master when becoming a data scientist or a machine learning engineer. Logistic regression is a robust machine learning algorithm that can do a fantastic job even at solving a very complex problem with 95% accuracy.

On the other hand, a generative classifier like a Naive Bayes will store all the classes' critical features and then classify based on the features the test case best fits.\",\n",

       " 'The Wald test, also known as the Wald Chi-Squared Test, is a method to find whether the independent variables in a model are of significance. The significance of variables is decided by whether they contribute to the predictions or not. The variables that add no value to the model can therefore be deleted without risking severe adverse effects to the model. The Wald test is unnecessary in linear regression because it is easy to compare a more complicated model to a simpler model to check the influence of the added independent variables. After all, we can use the R2 value to make this comparison. However, this is not possible with logistic regression as we use Maximum Likelihood Estimate, which uses the previously mentioned method infeasible. The Wald test can be used for many different models, including those with binary variables or continuous variables, and has the added advantage that it only requires estimating one model.',\n",

This helps, in turn, to preserve the overall trends in the data while not letting the model become too complex.

       " 'The Wald test, also known as the Wald Chi-Squared Test, is a method to find whether the independent variables in a model are of significance. The significance of variables is decided by whether they contribute to the predictions or not. The variables that add no value to the model can therefore be deleted without risking severe adverse effects to the model. The Wald test is unnecessary in linear regression because it is easy to compare a more complicated model to a simpler model to check the influence of the added independent variables. After all, we can use the R2 value to make this comparison. However, this is not possible with logistic regression as we use Maximum Likelihood Estimate, which uses the previously mentioned method infeasible. The Wald test can be used for many different models, including those with binary variables or continuous variables, and has the added advantage that it only requires estimating one model.',\n",

The odds serve to provide the constant effect a particular predictor or independent variable has on the output prediction. Expressing the effect of a predictor on the likelihood of the target having a particular value through probability does not describe this constant effect. In linear regression models, we often want to measure the unique effect of each independent variable on the output for which the odds are very useful.',\n",

Logistic regression learns to classify by knowing what features differentiate two or more classes of objects. For example, to classify between an apple and an orange, it will learn that the orange is orange in color and an apple is not. On the other hand, a generative classifier like a Naive Bayes will store all the classes' critical features and then classify based on the features the test case best fits.  \n",

The softmax represents each class with a value in the range (0,1), with all the values summing to 1. Alternatively, you could use the one-vs-all or one-vs-one approach using multiple simple binary classifiers.  \n",
       "3  The answer to this question is 'cannot be determined.' And this will remain the case unless you are provided additional data on the decision boundary. Let us say that you set the decision boundary such that y=1 is h(x)≥0.5 and 0; otherwise, then the answer for this question would be a resounding YES. However, if you set the decision boundary (although this is not very common practice) such that y=1 is h(x)≥0.6 and 0, otherwise the answer will be a NO.Get Closer To Your Dream of Becoming a Data Scientist with 70+ Solved End-to-End ML Projects  \n",

As a result, an attempt to find the parameters using gradient descent may fail to optimize cost function properly. It may end up choosing a local minima instead of the actual global minima.  "

How should you distribute the balls to achieve this goal? ', 'Answer: To maximize the probability of selecting a red ball if we choose one ball at random from one of the buckets, we should put one red ball in one bucket and the remaining balls in the other bucket.

', 'Answer: No, random sampling would not be an appropriate strategy to use if you want to work with a sample of the dataset of hourly temperature data over several years for the city you live in. The reason for this is that the hourly temperature data is likely to be correlated over time, meaning that each data point is influenced by the previous ones. Random sampling assumes that each data point is independent of the others, which is not the case in this scenario. Instead, you could consider using time-based sampling, where you take a sample at regular intervals throughout the time period you are interested in. This would allow you to capture the trends and patterns in the data over time, which would not be possible with random sampling.', 'Alternatively, you could consider using stratified sampling, where you divide the data into groups based on relevant characteristics (e.g., seasons, time of day, etc.) and then take a sample from each group.

The standard deviation measures the amount of variability or dispersion of the data from the mean. Here are some characteristics of the normal distribution with respect to its standard deviation:', '1) The standard deviation determines the shape of the normal curve. The standard deviation measures the amount of variability or dispersion of the data from the mean. When the standard deviation is small, it means that the data points are tightly clustered around the mean. This results in a probability distribution curve that is tall and narrow. On the other hand, when the standard deviation is large, it means that the data points are more spread out from the mean. This results in a probability distribution curve that is short and wide. 2) If the data follows a normal distribution, we can expect that roughly 68% of the data points will be within one standard deviation of the mean, while about 95% of the data points will be within two standard deviations of the mean, and approximately 99.7% of the data points will be within three standard deviations of the mean. 3) The standard deviation is used to calculate the Z-score, which is a measure of how many standard deviations a particular data point is from the mean. 4) The standard deviation can be used to calculate confidence intervals, which are a range of values that are likely to contain the true population mean with a certain level of confidence.', 'Overall, the standard deviation is a very important parameter of the normal distribution, as it helps to describe the spread and shape of the distribution, and allows for the calculation of various statistical measures.', '\\xa0', ' Tell me the difference between correlation and covariance.

There are several reasons for this:', 'Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.', 'Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes.

The reason for this is that the hourly temperature data is likely to be correlated over time, meaning that each data point is influenced by the previous ones. Random sampling assumes that each data point is independent of the others, which is not the case in this scenario. Instead, you could consider using time-based sampling, where you take a sample at regular intervals throughout the time period you are interested in. This would allow you to capture the trends and patterns in the data over time, which would not be possible with random sampling.',\n",

The standard deviation measures the amount of variability or dispersion of the data from the mean. Here are some characteristics of the normal distribution with respect to its standard deviation:',\n",
       " '1) The standard deviation determines the shape of the normal curve. The standard deviation measures the amount of variability or dispersion of the data from the mean. When the standard deviation is small, it means that the data points are tightly clustered around the mean. This results in a probability distribution curve that is tall and narrow. On the other hand, when the standard deviation is large, it means that the data points are more spread out from the mean. This results in a probability distribution curve that is short and wide. 2) If the data follows a normal distribution, we can expect that roughly 68% of the data points will be within one standard deviation of the mean, while about 95% of the data points will be within two standard deviations of the mean, and approximately 99.7% of the data points will be within three standard deviations of the mean. 3) The standard deviation is used to calculate the Z-score, which is a measure of how many standard deviations a particular data point is from the mean. 4) The standard deviation can be used to calculate confidence intervals, which are a range of values that are likely to contain the true population mean with a certain level of confidence.',\n",

Can you provide some examples of situations where a false positive or a false negative could be costly, and explain why precision or recall, respectively, is important in those cases? Answer: Precision and recall are both important metrics in evaluating the performance of classification models.Precision measures the proportion of true positives (i.e., the cases that were correctly classified as positive) among all positive predictions made by the model. In other words, it measures how accurate the model is when it predicts that a certain case belongs to the positive class.\\xa0\\xa0Give importance on precision when the cost of a false positive is high.\\xa0For example:In medical diagnosis, a false positive (predicting that a patient has a disease when they actually don’t) could lead to unnecessary treatments and procedures that are costly and potentially harmful.In credit fraud detection, a false positive (flagging a legitimate transaction as fraudulent) could result in blocking a legitimate purchase, which can negatively impact the customer experience and cause inconvenience.Recall means total true positives predicated cases among all actual positive cases. In other words, it measures how well the model identifies all the positive cases.\\xa0Recall is important when the cost of a false negative is high.\\xa0For example:In medical diagnosis, a false negative (failing to diagnose a disease in a patient who actually has it) could delay treatment and lead to further complications or even death.In spam email detection, a false negative (failing to flag a spam email as spam) could result in the user receiving unwanted emails, which can be a nuisance and potentially harmful if the email contains malicious content.In summary, precision is important when the cost of a false positive is high, while recall is important when the cost of a false negative is high.

       " '\\xa0Answer: Some common challenges of working with big data include data quality issues, processing and storage limitations, privacy and security concerns, and the need for specialized skills and tools.\\xa0 In a classification problem with imbalanced classes, where the majority class makes up 90% of the data and the minority class makes up 10%, a machine learning model achieves an accuracy score of 90%. Is this model good enough to deploy in a real-world scenario? Why or why not?? Answer: While an accuracy score of 90% may seem high at first glance, it can be misleading in cases of imbalanced classes. In this scenario, a model that simply classifies all instances as the majority class (i.e., without any actual learning taking place) would achieve an accuracy score of 90%, but it would be useless for practical purposes.In such cases, it is important to look beyond accuracy and consider other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which take into account the true positive rate and false positive rate for each class. For example, if the minority class is the one that is of greater interest, achieving high recall for that class may be more important than overall accuracy.Furthermore, it may be necessary to use techniques such as oversampling or undersampling of the minority class, or the use of more advanced algorithms such as ensemble methods, to improve the model’s performance on the minority class\\xa0 Suppose you are working on an anomaly detection problem where the goal is to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. The dataset contains 100,000 transactions, of which only 1,000 (1%) are labelled as fraud. You decide to use an unsupervised learning approach with a one-class support vector machine (SVM) to detect anomalies in the dataset. After training the model, you obtain a precision of 90% and a recall of 70% on the fraud class. Is this model likely to perform well on new, unseen data? Why or why not? Answer: In this scenario, the one-class SVM model achieved a relatively high precision of 90%, meaning that out of all transactions that the model classified as fraud, 90% were actually fraudulent. However, the recall of 70% indicates that the model missed 30% of the actual fraud transactions, which is a relatively high false negative rate.Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, achieving a high precision is important to minimize false positives, which would be flagged as potential fraud and require further investigation. However, missing actual fraud transactions is still a significant issue, and a high precision score does not necessarily imply good performance on new, unseen data.Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the one-class SVM model is likely to perform well on new, unseen data without further evaluation. It may be necessary to explore other evaluation metrics, such as the F1 score or the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and consider the specific context and cost associated with false positives and false negatives.\\xa0',\n",

You can distribute the balls between the buckets in any way you like, with the aim of maximizing the probability of selecting a red ball if you choose one ball at random from one of the buckets. How should you distribute the balls to achieve this goal? Answer: To maximize the probability of selecting a red ball if we choose one ball at random from one of the buckets, we should put one red ball in one bucket and the remaining balls in the other bucket. This will result in a probability of 74.4% of selecting a red ball if we choose one ball at random from one of the buckets. This is higher than the probability of 50% if we put all the red balls in one bucket and all the blue balls in the other bucket.The probability of selecting a red ball from the bucket with only one red ball is 1/2 because there are a total of 2 balls in that bucket. The probability of selecting a red ball from the other bucket is 39/79 because there are 39 red balls and 40 blue balls in that bucket.The overall probability of selecting a red ball is the weighted average of these two probabilities, which is: \\xa0 (1/2) * 1 + (1/2) * (39/79) = 0.7437 or approximately 74.4%\\xa0 \\xa0Suppose We have an hourly temperature of the city that you live in. We have gathered data over several years would random sampling be a good strategy to use if we want to work with a sample of the dataset? if yes why? if not why? Answer: No, random sampling would not be an appropriate strategy to use if you want to work with a sample of the dataset of hourly temperature data over several years for the city you live in. The reason for this is that the hourly temperature data is likely to be correlated over time, meaning that each data point is influenced by the previous ones. Random sampling assumes that each data point is independent of the others, which is not the case in this scenario. Instead, you could consider using time-based sampling, where you take a sample at regular intervals throughout the time period you are interested in. This would allow you to capture the trends and patterns in the data over time, which would not be possible with random sampling.Alternatively, you could consider using stratified sampling, where you divide the data into groups based on relevant characteristics (e.g., seasons, time of day, etc.) and then take a sample from each group. This would allow you to capture the variability in the data across different groups and ensure that your sample is representative of the entire dataset.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'Answer: The normal distribution is a bell-shaped probability distribution that is symmetric around its mean. It is characterized by two parameters: its mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ). The standard deviation measures the amount of variability or dispersion of the data from the mean. Here are some characteristics of the normal distribution with respect to its standard deviation:1) The standard deviation determines the shape of the normal curve. The standard deviation measures the amount of variability or dispersion of the data from the mean. When the standard deviation is small, it means that the data points are tightly clustered around the mean. This results in a probability distribution curve that is tall and narrow. On the other hand, when the standard deviation is large, it means that the data points are more spread out from the mean. This results in a probability distribution curve that is short and wide. 2) If the data follows a normal distribution, we can expect that roughly 68% of the data points will be within one standard deviation of the mean, while about 95% of the data points will be within two standard deviations of the mean, and approximately 99.7% of the data points will be within three standard deviations of the mean. 3) The standard deviation is used to calculate the Z-score, which is a measure of how many standard deviations a particular data point is from the mean. 4) The standard deviation can be used to calculate confidence intervals, which are a range of values that are likely to contain the true population mean with a certain level of confidence.Overall, the standard deviation is a very important parameter of the normal distribution, as it helps to describe the spread and shape of the distribution, and allows for the calculation of various statistical measures.\\xa0 Tell me the difference between correlation and covariance.

In this case, the model is not useful because it is not able to correctly identify instances of the positive class, which is the class of interest.

Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.\\xa0']"

       "      <td>What is data science, and what skills are required to be a successful data scientist? Answer: Data science is the field of extracting insights and knowledge from data using various techniques and tools. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves the use of statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data The skills required to be a successful data scientist include a strong foundation in statistics, programming, data visualization, and machine learning, big data technologies. Additionally, strong communication skills are necessary to present findings and insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  Tell me the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Answer: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the ML algorithm is trained on labeled data. The labeled data consists of input features and corresponding output labels. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a mapping function between the input features and output labels. Unsupervised learning where ML algorithm is trained on unlabelled data. The algorithm’s task in unsupervised learning is to find patterns or structures in the data without any prior knowledge of what the output should look like. In other words, the algorithm is not given any specific target to learn, and it has to discover the underlying patterns and relationships in the data by itself. Answer: There Data science and data analytics are two related but distinct fields that involve working with data to extract insights and inform decision-making.Data science is a broad field that encompasses a range of techniques and tools for extracting insights and knowledge from data. It involves the use of statistical modeling, machine learning, data visualization, and other techniques to explore and analyze data, build predictive models, and generate actionable insights. Data analytics, on the other hand, is a narrower field that focuses on analyzing data to identify patterns and trends and make data-driven decisions. It involves the use of statistical and quantitative analysis techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data.   What is the difference between machine learning, deep learning, and Artificial intelligence? Answer: There Machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are related concepts but have distinct differences.Machine learning is a subfield of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms is classified into 1) supervised learning, 2) unsupervised learning 3) reinforcement learning. These algorithms are used to train models to make predictions or classifications based on input data. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks to learn from large and complex datasets. Neural networks are composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes that can learn to recognize patterns and features in the data. Deep learning algorithms have been used to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Artificial intelligence refers to the broader field of developing intelligent computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human-level intelligence, such as reasoning, perception, and decision-making. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches, including machine learning and deep learning, as well as rule-based systems, expert systems, and knowledge representation.   What is the difference between business analytics and data analytics Answer: Business analytics and data analytics are two related but distinct fields that involve working with data to extract insights and inform decision-making in a business context.Data analytics is a broad field that involves the use of statistical and quantitative analysis techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and modeling. Business analytics, on the other hand, is a more focused field that involves the use of data analytics techniques to solve specific business problems or inform business decisions. It encompasses a range of techniques, including data mining, predictive analytics, and optimization, that are used to gain insights into business operations, customer behavior, and market trends.</td>\n",

       "      <td>What is the confusion Matrix and What is the difference between precision and recall?</td>\n",
       "      <td>Answer: A confusion matrix is a tool used in machine learning and statistical classification analysis to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted class labels with actual class labels. A confusion matrix means an error matrix and it’s always a square matrix with two dimensions.Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.  Can you explain the bias-variance trade-off? Answer: The bias-variance trade-off is the balancing act between overfitting and underfitting a model. A model with high bias will underfit the data and have poor accuracy, while a model with high variance will overfit the data and perform well on the training set but poorly on the test set.  What is regularization, and why is it useful in machine learning? Answer: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes large weights in a model. Regularization is one of the main techniques to handle overfitting in machine learning and helps to improve the generalization performance of ML models. There are two common types of regularization: L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term equal to the sum of the absolute values of the model’s coefficients. L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term equal to the sum of the squares of the model’s coefficients. Both L1 and L2 regularization encourage the model to have smaller coefficients, which can help to reduce overfitting.  Can you explain cross-validation? Answer: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate a model’s performance on new data by partitioning the available data into training and testing sets. This process is repeated multiple times, with different partitions used for training and testing, to obtain a more accurate estimate of the model’s performance.   What are the different types of cross-validation techniques?   Answer: Some common types of cross-validation techniques include:  What is the difference between a parametric and a non-parametric model? Answer: Parametric models make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, while non-parametric models do not make any assumptions. Parametric models are generally more efficient but less flexible than non-parametric models.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Answer: A common approach to a data science problem is to start by understanding the business problem and defining the problem statement. Next, explore the data and perform any necessary data cleaning and feature engineering. Then, select an appropriate model and train it on the data. Finally, evaluate the model’s performance and interpret the results.   What is the Central Limit Theorem, and why is it important in statistics? Answer: The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the underlying population, as the sample size increases. This is important because it allows us to use statistical inference to make inferences about the population based on a sample. What is the curse of dimensionality, and how does it affect machine learning models? Answer: The curse of dimensionality refers to the problem of having a large number of features or variables in a dataset, which can lead to overfitting and poor performance of machine learning models. This is because as the number of dimensions increases, the number of data points required to avoid overfitting also increases exponentially. What is overfitting, and how can it be prevented? Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the noise in the data, rather than the underlying patterns. Overfitting can be prevented by using regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, or by using a simpler model that has fewer parameters.</td>\n",

       "0   What is data science, and what skills are required to be a successful data scientist? Answer: Data science is the field of extracting insights and knowledge from data using various techniques and tools. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves the use of statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data The skills required to be a successful data scientist include a strong foundation in statistics, programming, data visualization, and machine learning, big data technologies. Additionally, strong communication skills are necessary to present findings and insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  Tell me the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Answer: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the ML algorithm is trained on labeled data. The labeled data consists of input features and corresponding output labels. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a mapping function between the input features and output labels. Unsupervised learning where ML algorithm is trained on unlabelled data. The algorithm’s task in unsupervised learning is to find patterns or structures in the data without any prior knowledge of what the output should look like. In other words, the algorithm is not given any specific target to learn, and it has to discover the underlying patterns and relationships in the data by itself. Answer: There Data science and data analytics are two related but distinct fields that involve working with data to extract insights and inform decision-making.Data science is a broad field that encompasses a range of techniques and tools for extracting insights and knowledge from data. It involves the use of statistical modeling, machine learning, data visualization, and other techniques to explore and analyze data, build predictive models, and generate actionable insights. Data analytics, on the other hand, is a narrower field that focuses on analyzing data to identify patterns and trends and make data-driven decisions. It involves the use of statistical and quantitative analysis techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data.   What is the difference between machine learning, deep learning, and Artificial intelligence? Answer: There Machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are related concepts but have distinct differences.Machine learning is a subfield of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms is classified into 1) supervised learning, 2) unsupervised learning 3) reinforcement learning. These algorithms are used to train models to make predictions or classifications based on input data. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks to learn from large and complex datasets. Neural networks are composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes that can learn to recognize patterns and features in the data. Deep learning algorithms have been used to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Artificial intelligence refers to the broader field of developing intelligent computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human-level intelligence, such as reasoning, perception, and decision-making. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches, including machine learning and deep learning, as well as rule-based systems, expert systems, and knowledge representation.   What is the difference between business analytics and data analytics Answer: Business analytics and data analytics are two related but distinct fields that involve working with data to extract insights and inform decision-making in a business context.Data analytics is a broad field that involves the use of statistical and quantitative analysis techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and modeling. Business analytics, on the other hand, is a more focused field that involves the use of data analytics techniques to solve specific business problems or inform business decisions. It encompasses a range of techniques, including data mining, predictive analytics, and optimization, that are used to gain insights into business operations, customer behavior, and market trends.    \n",

A confusion matrix means an error matrix and it’s always a square matrix with two dimensions.Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.  Can you explain the bias-variance trade-off? Answer: The bias-variance trade-off is the balancing act between overfitting and underfitting a model. A model with high bias will underfit the data and have poor accuracy, while a model with high variance will overfit the data and perform well on the training set but poorly on the test set.  What is regularization, and why is it useful in machine learning? Answer: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes large weights in a model. Regularization is one of the main techniques to handle overfitting in machine learning and helps to improve the generalization performance of ML models. There are two common types of regularization: L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term equal to the sum of the absolute values of the model’s coefficients. L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term equal to the sum of the squares of the model’s coefficients. Both L1 and L2 regularization encourage the model to have smaller coefficients, which can help to reduce overfitting.  Can you explain cross-validation? Answer: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate a model’s performance on new data by partitioning the available data into training and testing sets. This process is repeated multiple times, with different partitions used for training and testing, to obtain a more accurate estimate of the model’s performance.   What are the different types of cross-validation techniques?   Answer: Some common types of cross-validation techniques include:  What is the difference between a parametric and a non-parametric model? Answer: Parametric models make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, while non-parametric models do not make any assumptions. Parametric models are generally more efficient but less flexible than non-parametric models.   \n",

The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the model parameters and iteratively updates the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function until it reaches a minimum.    \n",

Next, explore the data and perform any necessary data cleaning and feature engineering. Then, select an appropriate model and train it on the data. Finally, evaluate the model’s performance and interpret the results.   What is the Central Limit Theorem, and why is it important in statistics? Answer: The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the underlying population, as the sample size increases. This is important because it allows us to use statistical inference to make inferences about the population based on a sample. What is the curse of dimensionality, and how does it affect machine learning models? Answer: The curse of dimensionality refers to the problem of having a large number of features or variables in a dataset, which can lead to overfitting and poor performance of machine learning models. This is because as the number of dimensions increases, the number of data points required to avoid overfitting also increases exponentially. What is overfitting, and how can it be prevented? Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the noise in the data, rather than the underlying patterns. Overfitting can be prevented by using regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, or by using a simpler model that has fewer parameters.  "

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.</td>\n",

It is mostly done with the help of the Sum of Squared Residuals Method, known as the Ordinary least squares (OLS) method.                                                       Image Source: Google Images   \n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.   \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)  \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.   \n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.</td>\n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.   \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)  \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.   \n",

Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

It is visualized by a single point.Regression: It measures how one variable affects another variable. Regression is all about model fitting. It tries to capture the causality and describes the cause and the effect. It is visualized by a regression line.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.</td>\n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.   \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)  \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.   \n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.</td>\n",

It is mostly done with the help of the Sum of Squared Residuals Method, known as the Ordinary least squares (OLS) method.                                                       Image Source: Google Images   \n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.   \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)  \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.   \n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

It is mostly done with the help of the Sum of Squared Residuals Method, known as the Ordinary least squares (OLS) method.                                                       Image Source: Google Images   \n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.   \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)  \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.   \n",

Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

       "      <td>What is ANOVA in statistics?</td>\n",
       "      <td>Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.</td>\n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.    \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)   \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.    \n",

Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.</td>\n",

It is mostly done with the help of the Sum of Squared Residuals Method, known as the Ordinary least squares (OLS) method.                                                       Image Source: Google Images    \n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.    \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)   \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.    \n",

Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.</td>\n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.    \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)   \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.    \n",

       "      <td>The basic assumptions of the Linear regression algorithm are as follows: Linearity: The relationship between the features and target. Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.</td>\n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.    \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)   \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.    \n",

       "      <td>The basic assumptions of the Linear regression algorithm are as follows: Linearity: The relationship between the features and target. Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.</td>\n",

Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data.    \n",

In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)   \n",

       "516  Answer: ANOVA (analysis of variance) in statistics is a technique used to test whether there are differences in means between three or more groups. It involves comparing the variability between groups to the variability within groups, and determining whether the observed differences in means are statistically significant.  What is a p-value in statistics? Answer: A p-value in statistics is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of getting a test statistic the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value means you can say that you have stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.  Accuracy is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of the classifier. Justify Answer: Accuracy alone is not an adequate metric to evaluate the quality of a classifier. There are several reasons for this:Class imbalance: In many classification problems, the classes may not be balanced, i.e., one class may have significantly more instances than the other. In such cases, a classifier that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, but it will not be useful in practice. In such cases, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate to evaluate the performance of the classifier.Cost of errors: In some classification problems, the cost of misclassification errors may vary for different classes. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a disease when it is present) may be more costly than a false positive (i.e., diagnosing a disease when it is not present). In such cases, accuracy alone may not be an adequate metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier, and other metrics that take into account the cost of errors, such as cost-sensitive learning or ROC curves, may be more appropriate.Ambiguous instances: In some classification problems, some instances may be ambiguous, i.e., they may not clearly belong to one class or the other. In such cases, a classifier may make errors even if it is performing well in general. In such cases, other metrics such as precision and recall may be more appropriate, as they focus on the performance of the classifier on instances that are unambiguously classified.    \n",

It transfers the error information from the end of the network to all the weights inside the network. It allows the efficient computation of the gradient.Backpropagation can be divided into the following steps: It can forward propagation of training data through the network to generate output. It uses target value and output value to compute error derivative concerning output activations. It can backpropagate to compute the derivative of the error concerning output activations in the previous layer and continue for all hidden layers. It uses the previously calculated derivatives for output and all hidden layers to calculate the error derivative concerning weights. It updates the weights. \u001b[0m\n",
